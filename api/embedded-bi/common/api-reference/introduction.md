# Introduction
Bold BI is a powerful business intelligence dashboard software that helps you gain meaningful insights from your business data and make better decisions.

Bold BI provides a RESTful web API that allows other third-party applications to interact with Embedded BI programmatically. It supports read, create, edit, and delete operations, which are usually in JSON format. Users, groups, dashboards, data sources, and settings, among other items, can be handled using REST APIs.

If `https://<yourdomain>/bi/site/<site_identifier>` is your Bold BI site URL, then API end of this site will be accessed by `https://{yourdomain}/bi/api/site/<site_identifier>`

# Getting Started
## HTTP Methods
HTTP defines a collection of request methods that can be used to determine the action to be taken. The following HTTP methods are used to manipulate and retrieve data in Bold BI.

|    Method    |      Description                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| GET          |  Retrieve Data                       |
| POST         |  Create resources and perform actions|
| PUT          |  Update Data                         |
| DELETE       |  Delete Data                         |


## Response Status
Response status codes are used by Bold BI to indicate whether API calls were successful or unsuccessful. This will assist you in determining the error or message type.

The following table shows the HTTP status codes used in the Bold BI.

| **Status Code** | **Message**                | **Details**                                                                                                                                                      |

## Content Header
The Content-Type HTTP header must be set in request headers to make a Post/Put request with JSON. In Bold BI, the following Content-Types are supported:

 - **Content-Type:** application/json
 - **Content-Type:** application/x-www-form-urlencoded


The Content-Type header in the response headers specifies the type of content returned by the server. In Bold BI, the following Content-Type header will be present.

 - **Content-Type:** application/json

## Conventions
