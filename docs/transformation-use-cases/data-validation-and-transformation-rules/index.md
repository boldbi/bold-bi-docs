# Data Validation and Transformation Rules  

## Overview:  
Apply business rules to ensure that only valid and relevant data enters the system.

## Transformations:  

1. **Status Verification:**  
   - If a ticketâ€™s status is marked as "resolved", but the resolution time is still null, apply transformation rules to flag or correct such issues.

2. **Compliance Validation:**  
   - Ensure data adheres to internal policies (e.g., tickets should have valid email addresses or phone numbers).

3. **Flagging Suspicious Data:**  
   - Use rules to flag records with conflicting information (e.g., an "open" ticket with a "resolved" status).
