# Aggregation and Summarization  

## Overview:  

Aggregate the data to provide high-level metrics for reporting or analysis.  

## Transformations:  

1. **Ticket Count by Agent:** 
 
   - Aggregate the number of tickets resolved by each customer service agent within a specific period (e.g., daily, weekly).

2. **Computing Performance KPIs:**  

   - Calculate the average, minimum, and maximum resolution times for each service category.
