# Anomaly Detection and Smoothing

## Overview:  

Detect and manage outliers or anomalies in customer service center (CSC) data to ensure data accuracy and reliability.  

## Transformations:  

1. **Outlier Detection:**  
   - Identify anomalies in ticket resolution patterns, including unusually high service durations, unexpected spikes in customer complaints, or irregular ticket volumes.

2. **Anomaly Flagging:**  
   - Apply anomaly detection techniques to flag tickets with outlier response times or resolution times for further investigation.

3. **Data Smoothing:**  
   - Use rolling averages or other smoothing techniques to adjust for seasonal ticket volume spikes and extract meaningful trends without distortion from rare events.
