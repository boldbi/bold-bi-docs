# Data Smoothing and Transforming Data Using Bold Data Hub  

In this article, we will demonstrate how to import tables from a CSV file, smooth data through transformations, and move the cleaned data into the destination database using **Bold Data Hub**. Follow the step-by-step process below.


**Sample Data Source:**

## Data Smoothing  

### Overview  

Ticket volumes may exhibit seasonal spikes, making it difficult to analyze long-term trends. By applying rolling averages, we can smooth fluctuations and gain clearer insights into underlying patterns.  

### Approach
  
We use a **rolling average** to normalize ticket resolution data and detect anomalies. If an agentâ€™s resolution time significantly exceeds the average (by more than **2 standard deviations**), it is flagged as an anomaly.  

### SQL Query for Data Smoothing  

```sql
WITH Agent_Resolution AS (
    SELECT 
        Agent_ID, 
        Agent_Name, 
        COUNT(Ticket_ID) AS Resolved_Tickets, 
        AVG(Resolution_Time) AS Avg_Resolution_Time, 
        STDDEV(Resolution_Time) AS Std_Dev_Resolution 
    FROM {pipeline_name}.sample_csc_data 
    WHERE Ticket_Status = 'Resolved' AND Resolution_Time IS NOT NULL 
    GROUP BY Agent_ID, Agent_Name
) 
SELECT 
    t.Ticket_ID, 
    t.Agent_ID, 
    t.Agent_Name, 
    t.Resolution_Time, 
    CASE 
        WHEN t.Resolution_Time > (a.Avg_Resolution_Time + 2 * a.Std_Dev_Resolution) 
        THEN 'Anomaly' 
        ELSE 'Normal' 
    END AS Resolution_Anomaly 
FROM {pipeline_name}.sample_csc_data t 
JOIN Agent_Resolution a ON t.Agent_ID = a.Agent_ID 
WHERE t.Ticket_Status = 'Resolved';
```
