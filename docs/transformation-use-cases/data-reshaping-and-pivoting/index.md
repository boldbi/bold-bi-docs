# Data Pivoting and Reshaping

## Overview: 

To ensure high-quality and reliable data for further processing, the CSC data must be cleaned and standardized. This process helps improve data accuracy, consistency, and usability.  


## Transformations:

1. **Pivot Data:** Reshape data to create a table where each column represents a distinct time period (e.g., monthly ticket counts for each service type). [Learn more about Pivot Tables](/transformation-use-cases/data-reshaping-and-pivoting/pivot-data/)<br>

2. **Flatten Nested Data:** If the data is in nested structures (like JSON), flatten it into a table format for easier analysis. [Learn more about Flatten Nested Data](/transformation-use-cases/data-reshaping-and-pivoting/flatten-nested-data/)<br>

3. **Create Derived Columns:** For example, create a column that combines customer status (new vs. returning) with ticket priority to gain more granular insights. [Learn more about Create Derived Columns](/transformation-use-cases/data-reshaping-and-pivoting/create-derived-columns/)<br>
