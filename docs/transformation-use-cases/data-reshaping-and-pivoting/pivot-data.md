## Pivot Tables for Reshaping Data

### Overview  

Pivot tables allow us to restructure data by summarizing it in a way that is easy to analyze.

### Approach  

We can create a transformation table to pivot the equipmentâ€™s status into separate column based on its status and the values are aggregated counts based on its status. 

This helps to identify purchase state and action need to be taken,

### SQL Query for Creating a Pivot Table  

```sql

SELECT row_number() OVER() AS id, * 
FROM (
   PIVOT (
Select "Hospital_ID",
"Location",
"Equipment",
"Status",
"Count"
       FROM healthcare_equipmentdata.data2
   ) ON "Status" 
   USING MAX(Count)
) ct;

```
