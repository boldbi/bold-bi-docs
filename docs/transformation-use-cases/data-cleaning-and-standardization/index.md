# Data Cleaning and Standardization

## Overview: 
To ensure high-quality and reliable data for further processing, the CSC data must be cleaned and standardized. This process helps improve data accuracy, consistency, and usability.  


## Transformations:
1. **Remove Duplicates:** Identify and eliminate duplicate records based on unique identifiers (e.g., Customer ID, Ticket ID). [Learn more about Removing Duplicates](/transformation-use-cases/data-cleaning-and-standardization/filtering-duplicate-data/)<br>

2. **Handling Null Values:** Replace null or missing values with predefined defaults or impute values based on averages (e.g., for customer ratings or service timestamps). [Learn more about Null Value Handling](/transformation-use-cases/data-cleaning-and-standardization/handling-null-values/)<br>

3. **Data Type Conversion:** Ensure fields like dates, amounts, or customer ratings are in the correct format (e.g., converting text-based dates to a DATE format). [Learn more about Data Type Conversion](/transformation-use-cases/data-cleaning-and-standardization/data-type-conversion/)<br>

4. **Filtering Invalid Entries:** Filter out records with invalid or inconsistent data (e.g., negative ticket costs, invalid phone numbers). [Learn more about Removing Invalid Data](/transformation-use-cases/data-cleaning-and-standardization/filtering-invalid-data/)<br>
