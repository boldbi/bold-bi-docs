## Creating a Customer Journey Map

### Overview  

A customer journey map helps to visualize and understand each customer's experience by analyzing their interaction history. By aggregating data from various touchpoints, such as support tickets, we can track a customer's path from their first interaction to the most recent one. This analysis helps identify patterns and improve customer experience.

### Approach
  
We aggregate the support tickets based on **`Customer_ID`**, ordered by **`Ticket_Creation_Date`** to analyze the sequence of interactions. This allows us to track the customerâ€™s journey over time and identify recurring issues or improvements.

### SQL Query for Creating a Customer Journey Map  

```sql
SELECT 
    Customer_ID, 
    Customer_Name, 
    MIN(Ticket_Creation_Date) AS First_Interaction, 
    MAX(Ticket_Creation_Date) AS Last_Interaction, 
    COUNT(Ticket_ID) AS Total_Tickets, 
    AVG(Resolution_Time) AS Avg_Resolution_Time, 
    AVG(Customer_Satisfaction) AS Avg_Satisfaction 
FROM {pipeline_name}.sample_csc_data 
GROUP BY Customer_ID, Customer_Name 
ORDER BY Last_Interaction DESC;
```
