## Mapping Customer Regions  

### Overview
  
If the customerâ€™s region is stored as a text field (e.g., a city name or abbreviation), mapping it to a standardized region or country code ensures uniformity in data representation.  

### Approach
  
We use a **`CASE`** statement to map region abbreviations to full country names.  

### SQL Query for Mapping Customer Regions  

```sql
SELECT 
    t.*, 
    CASE 
        WHEN t.Region = 'CA' THEN 'CANADA' 
        WHEN t.Region = 'UK' THEN 'United Kingdom' 
        WHEN t.Region = 'USA' THEN 'United States' 
        ELSE 'Other' 
    END AS Standardized_Region 
FROM {pipeline_name}.sample_csc_data t;
```
