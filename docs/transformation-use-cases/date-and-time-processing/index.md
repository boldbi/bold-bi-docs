# Date and Time Adjustments  

## Overview:  
Normalize and handle time-related data for reporting and analysis.  

## Transformations:  

1. **Timestamp Conversion:**  
   - Convert raw timestamps into readable formats like `YYYY-MM-DD` or adjust them to the correct time zone.  
   - [Learn more about Timestamp Conversion](/transformation-use-cases/date-and-time-processing/timestamp-conversion/)  

2. **Calculate Service Duration:**  
   - Compute the time difference between ticket creation and resolution time to determine resolution duration.  
   - [Learn more about Service Duration Calculation](/transformation-use-cases/date-and-time-processing/calculate-service-duration/)  

3. **Time-based Segmentation:**  
   - Extract hour or day-of-week features from timestamp fields to analyze service center load patterns.

4. **Generate Time Intervals:**  
   - Categorize service request response time into "Fast", "Medium", or "Slow" based on predefined thresholds.
