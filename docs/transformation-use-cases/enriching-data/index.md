## Overview:  
Combine CSC data with additional information to provide deeper insights.  

## Transformations:  

1. **Integrating External Data:**  
   - Integrate CSC data with CRM data (e.g., customer demographics, loyalty program status) to enrich each support ticket with customer-related attributes.
