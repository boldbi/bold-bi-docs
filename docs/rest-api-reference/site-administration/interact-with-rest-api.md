# Interact with Our REST API

This section explains how to use our interactive API documentation.

You need to get an access token to authenticate the API end points to get the responses.

## Get Access Token
Each client has its own unique token to authenticate requests, which should be added to the header of the request.

To get the `Client Token`, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the appropriate interactive REST API documentation link.
     * [v1.0](https://help.boldbi.com/embedded-bi/rest-api-reference/site-administration/v1.0/try-it-now/)
     * [v2.0](https://help.boldbi.com/embedded-bi/rest-api-reference/site-administration/v2.0/try-it-now/)
2. Expand `Authentication` and click `Try it out`.

3. We have already hosted our application for public demonstration at [this](https://onpremise-demo.boldbi.com/) domain. Using the public demo, you have to get the access token with the following sample credential.

     **client_id** - `92773343-b3d8-4fb6-adcb-31568bfdd259`

     **grant_type** - `client_credentials`

     **client_secret** - `TfICgjhA31+roPaVHE56gr+VKjc1Z7DOKx0FURuUIGFgUIOD/cPYUg/jATbC3h/r7zoMvtrMaqe/TXJRNIiKjg==`

4. Click `Execute`, and you will get the response as follows. Get the `access_token` from the Response body.

5. Now you have to add the `access_token` for further API calls as an Authorization header.
6. Click the `Authorize` button, which is located in the top-right corner of the page.

7. A dialog will open; enter the access token in the `Value` box with this format: **'Bearer' + access_token** and click the `Authorize` button.

8. Now, you can interact with the other REST APIs with the needed respective parameters, which are mentioned in each API.
