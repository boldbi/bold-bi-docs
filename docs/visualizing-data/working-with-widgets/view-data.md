# Viewing widgets underlying data

You can view the data bound to the widget by enabling the View data option under the Container Appearance section in the property panel.

The selected widget will have a new menu for viewing data, along with the export menu, as shown in the following image.

## View data

By default, the column values configured with the widget are displayed in view data. The **Select Column** button can be seen at the top right of the dialog.

When we click the **Select Column** button, a list box containing the columns in the data source configured in widgets will be displayed.

We can select one or more specific columns in the list box, then click the **Apply** button.

The values of the selected columns will be shown in the view data grid once you click the **Apply** button.

By checking the **Select All** field, we can display all column values in the data source.

We can also export the selected/all column(s) value into a CSV or Excel file by clicking the **Export** options.

You will be able to see the fetched records count out of the total records on the popup, as shown.

## View Data Customization
The `View Data Actions` section in the property panel provides options to enable or disable the exporting and column selection features inside the view data dialog using the `Allow Exporting` and `Allow Column Selection` settings. By default, both options are enabled.

When `Allow Exporting` and `Allow Column Selection` are disabled, the `Export` and `Select Column` options in the View underlying data will be hidden, as shown below.
