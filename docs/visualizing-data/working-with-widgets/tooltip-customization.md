# Tooltip customization in the widgets

Tooltips help users understand the exact numerical representation of the data records displayed in the widgets. They are informative and provide a robust way for users to explore raw data for a specific period or point, instead of showing all records at once in the visual. 

Initially, the widgets show the configured data values and corresponding data points' category as default tooltip information when hovering the mouse, as shown in the screenshots below.

*Chart widget: Shows the total sales amount for the sold top 5 categories.*

*Map widget: Shows the total number of medals won by each country during the 2016 Summer Olympics.*

Additional information can be showcased in the tooltip without affecting the visualization of the configured widget.

To do this, configure additional tooltip fields in the applicable widgets. This will display extra information alongside the default tooltip information.

The following sections discuss how to add additional tooltip fields and how to format the data values displayed in the tooltip.

## How to configure additional tooltip fields in the widgets

1.	Open the dashboard in the ` Dashboard Designer`. 
2.	Select the `widget` in the design layout where you want to add additional tooltip fields.
3.	Click the `properties` icon as shown in the screenshot.

6.	Now, the widget will be rendered and on mouse hover, it will show the additional information as tooltip points for the configured measure.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> * Only measure fields are allowed as additional tooltip fields. If a Dimension field is added to the tooltip section, it will only act as a measure field.
> * This section is optional. If no additional fields are required, you do not need to add any fields in the tooltip section.
> * Tooltip fields do not affect the visualization and values are displayed only in the tooltip points.
> * You can add any number of tooltip fields as needed.
> * All types of charts, Choropleth Map, Bubble Map, Map, Tree map, and Heat map support tooltip fields.
> * Tooltip fields are currently not supported in Radial Gauge, Grid, Pivot Grid, Image, Label, and filter widgets. 

## How to format the tooltip values
