# Collaborate with your team by enabling comments in the Widgets

You can comment on individual widgets on the site. You can toggle the `Enable Comments` option in the properties tab of individual widgets.

## Commenting a widget

To enable comments for a widget, select that widget after opening the `Properties Tab`, and select `Enable Comments` under the `Container Appearance` section. By default, this option is enabled.
