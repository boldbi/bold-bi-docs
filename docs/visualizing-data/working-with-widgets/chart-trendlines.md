# Trendlines

Trendlines help determine the general pattern or overall direction of the data in the chart widget. You can add more than one trendline to Cartesian charts, except for bar type series (Line, Column, Area, Spline) and stacked types of charts. You are able to add, edit, and delete trendlines.

## Add and edit trendline

1. The trendlines option can be found under the `properties` tab of the applicable chart widgets.

### Line type

The line type can be selected from the Line Type drop-down option (`Linear, Exponential, Logarithmic, Power, and Polynomial`).

### Line Width

You can set the width of the trendline.

### Line color

The color of the trendline can be changed using the `Line Color` color picker.

### Line style

The style of the trendline can be changed by selecting from the Line Style drop-down option (`Solid, Dot, Dash, DotDash, LongDash, and LongDashDotDot`).
