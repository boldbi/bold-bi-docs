# Linking URLs in dashboards

URL linking allows you to link the dashboard with valid web URLs. 

You can link URLs to a visualization widget by enabling the `Enable Link` property. 

The `Enable Link` option is available in the `Properties` tab of the widgets.

By default, the `Enable Link` property will remain unchecked.

![Unchecked link property](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/link1.PNG)

To enable linking, select the `Enable Link` checkbox.

![Checked link property](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/Link1a.PNG)

Enter the Web URL in the `URL` text box. If you click on the column names listed in the `Append Column` name list, it will be appended to the URL entered in the URL text box.

For the `Grid widget`, you can get a `URL` based on `Row` and `Column`.

### Row

Enter the Web URL in the `URL` text box. If you click on the column names listed in the `Append Column` name list, it will be appended to the URL entered in the URL text box.

You can preview the linked URL using the `URL preview` option. If you click the preview URL link, it will be opened in a browser. 

### Column

You can select the column.

![Select column](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/Linking08.PNG)

 Choose the field from the `Choose Field` property listed in the combo box.

![Choose field property](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/Linking09.PNG)

Add the web `Url` in the URL text box. 

![Linking URL](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/LinkingURL.PNG)

![Add URL](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/LinkingURL1.PNG)

Click the Add button shown below to add the field.

![Add button](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/Linkingadd.PNG)

Now, the field will be added with the URL.

## Dashboard Parameter support in URL Linking
URL Linking allows you to use both the [Dashboard Parameter](/working-with-data-sources/dashboard-parameter/configuring-dashboard-parameters/) and [Default Parameter](/working-with-data-sources/dashboard-parameter/change-the-dashboard-parameter-value-in-url/#default-parameters). You can create a dynamic link based on the current domain, dashboard, and category by referring to the info icon placed at the right side of the URL text box.

**Syntax** : `@{{:CURRENT.SITEURL}}/dashboards?dashboardName={dashboard_name}&categoryName={category_name}`

  - `@{{:CURRENT.SITEURL}}` - This `Default parameter` will automatically populate the URL of the current site.
  - `{dashboard_name}` - Specify the name of the dashboard you want to link.
  - `{category_name}` - Specify the name of the category under which the dashboard has been published.

For Example, the dynamic URL can be created as `@{{:CURRENT.SITEURL}}/dashboards?dashboardName=Sales Analysis Dashboard&categoryName=Sales`.

Refer the URL info as shown in following image.

![Dynamic URL](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/LinkingURLInfo.png)

Based on the above syntax, create the dynamic linking URL using the `Default parameter` and `Dashboard Parameter` as shown in the image.

## Advanced Url Linking

The linked url's target can be changed with the help of a drop down as shown in the following image.
![Advanced target](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/LinkingAdvancedTarget.png)

The target can be changed from the `New tab`, `Same page`, `Current frame`, `Parent frame`, `Pop up` and  `New Window`.
<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Target</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New tab</td>
<td>Opens the linked document in a new tab or window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Same page</td>
<td>Opens the linked document in the full body of the window in which it is clicked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Current frame</td>
<td>Opens the linked document in the same iframe as it was clicked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Parent frame</td>
<td>Opens the linked document in the parent iframe from which the current frame is generated.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Pop up
This target type helps you to open the linked document inside a pop-up window. The title of the same pop-up window can also be set in the input box provided as shown in the following image.

![Advanced title](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/LinkingAdvancedTitle.png)

When you open the linked document, it will appear as shown in the following image.

![Advanced popup](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/LinkingAdvancedPopup.png)

### New Window
This target type helps you to open the linked document in a separate browser window. The specific `Height` and `Width` of the required window can be updated as shown in the following image.

![Advanced dimensions](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/LinkingAdvancedDimensions.png)

When you open the linked document with the above dimensions, it will appear as shown in the following image.

![Advanced window](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/LinkingAdvancedWindow.png)

## Encryption query Parameter

This property, `Encrypt Parameters`, allows you to encrypt the filter parameter that will be used in the URL text area under the `Link` category in the `Properties` tab of the widget.

To enable this property, select the `Encrypt Parameters` checkbox as shown in the following image.

![Advanced window](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/encryption-parameter.png#max-width=50%)

Preview the dashboard, then click the `Link` option from the widget. After opening the linked dashboard, it will appear as shown in the following image.

![Advanced window](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/linking-encryption.png#max-width=100%)

![Advanced window](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/encryption-result.png#max-width=100%)

## Include Master Widget Filters

This option allows the selected filter values from the chosen master widget to be automatically passed to the navigated dashboard via the `URL parameters`, without the need to manually append parameters.

![Include Master Widget Filters](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/IncludeMasterWidgetsFilter.png)

You can select the master widgets from the `Choose Master Widgets` dropdown. It will display the configured master widgets in the current dashboard. By default, all widgets are selected.

![Choose Master Widgets](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/Choosemasterwidgets.png)

For example, in the dashboard shown below, the Year-configured filter widget is used as the chosen master widget for the slave widget, with 2024 selected as the value. Upon navigation, the selected value is automatically passed to the destination dashboard via a `URL parameter`.

![Example Passing Filter](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/examplefilterurl.png)

### Preserving URL Filters Across Dashboard Navigation

By using this option, you can pass `URL parameter` filter values to the navigated dashboard. As a result, users can transfer the parent dashboard's filter information to all subsequently navigated dashboards via `URL parameters`.

For example, in the dashboard shown below, a country filter has been applied using the filter widget, and an additional filter has been applied via `URL parameters`. After navigation, the second dashboard will be rendered with both filters applied, as shown in the second image. If you navigate to a third dashboard, these filters will continue to be passed along.

![First dashboard Filter](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/firstdashboardlink_URL.png)

![Second dashboard Passing Filter](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/Seconddashboard_URL.png)

> **NOTE:** If the selected master widgets are not filtered, then no values should be passed to the `URL`.

## URL Query Parameter Mapping

This allows you to replace the long query parameters with mapped key, which is used in the URL text area under the `Link` category in the `Properties` tab of the widget.

To enable this property, select the `URL Query Parameter Mapping` checkbox as shown in the following image.

![URL Mapping Link property](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/mappingURLProperty.png)

Open the dashboard and click the `Link` option on the widget. The linked dashboard will then open and appear as shown in the image below.

![URL Mapping Link option](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/mapPreviewLink.png)

>**NOTE:** This is applicable only when the dashboard is in view mode.
