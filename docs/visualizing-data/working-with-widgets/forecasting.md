# Forecast in Dashboard

Bold BI allows you to forecast future data when visualizing your data in a chart. Our forecasting includes built-in models that allow prediction based on exponential smoothing techniques. Forecasting in Bold BI can be applied to both seasonal and non-seasonal data points. For seasonal data, seasonality can be automatically detected based on historical data. Our forecasting model also supports bound value prediction using an adjustable confidence interval.

## Enabling forecast in charts

This document explains how to enable and configure forecasts in your charts.

1. To enable forecast settings, only one `Column` and one `Value` field need to be included in your chart.

    ![Add Fields](/static/assets/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/forecastassigndata.png)

    Supported data types in the Column field:   
    * Numeric
    * Numeric
    * DateTime
    * Date
    * Year
    * Quarter Year
    * Month Year
    * Week Year
    * Day Month Year
    * Month Day Year        

    The Value field supports only `Numeric` type.

2. After adding the column and value in the chart, the `Forecast Settings` option will be displayed in the `Properties` panel.

3. Click `Enable` to apply the forecast in the chart.

4. After enabling the forecast, the chart will be updated with forecast, upper, and lower bound data points.

5. The following properties are used to configure forecast data points:

   `Length` can be used to define the number of forecast data points to be included in the chart, with the default length set to 10.

   `Confidence Interval` can be used to define the range for lower and upper bound values, with the default confidence interval set to 95%.

   `Seasonality` is set to auto by default and will be predicted automatically based on seasonal input data. If you want to set any seasonality period explicitly for your seasonal input data, then this option can be used. 

6. The following properties are used to customize forecast design:

    `Forecast` can be used to customize the color of the forecast line.

    `Confidence` can be used to customize the color of upper and lower bound data points.

    `Confidence Band Style` can be used to define the display style of upper and lower bound data points:

    * `Fill` will display shaded color between the upper and lower bound range.
    * `Line` will display upper and lower bound values with lines.
    * `Dot` will display upper and lower bound values with dotted lines.

## Limitations on Forecasting
Forecasting is a valuable tool for predicting future data trends, but it comes with specific limitations. These limitations are essential to understand to effectively use the forecasting feature in the `Line` and `Spline` chart widgets. Below are the detailed constraints:

#### General Limitations
- Forecasting is exclusively available for `Line` and `Spline` charts. Other chart types do not support the forecasting feature.
- Forecasting can only be used when the data is configured with a single measure field and a single column field. It does not support the use of multiple measures, multiple columns, or single rows within this context.
- The forecasting feature only supports specific date formats. The following date formats are not compatible with the forecasting functionality:
     - Date and time
     - Quarter
     - Month
     - Datehour
     - Times (hour, minutes, seconds)
- The Tooltip feature cannot be used for the forecast line. If a column is configured in the `Tooltip` container under the `Assign Data` section, the data from that column will not appear in the forecasting tooltip.
- The `Drilldown` feature is not supported when using forecasting.
- In the `Property` section, specifically within the `Legend` settings, it is not possible to customize the Legend text for forecast series.
- It is not possible to disable Tooltip visibility for forecast series within the `Tooltip` settings in the `Property` section.
- If the `Master` filter is activated, it will not function with the forecasting feature.
