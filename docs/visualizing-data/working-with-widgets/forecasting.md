# Forecast in Dashboard

Bold BI allows you to forecast the future data when visualizing your data in chart. Our forecasting has built-in models that allows prediction based on exponential smoothing technique. Forecasting in Bold BI can be applied on both seasonal and non-seasonal data points. For seasonal data, you can automatically detect the seasonality based on historical data. Our forecasting model also supports bound value prediction using adjustable confidence interval.

## Enabling forecast in charts

This document explains how to enable and configure forecast in your charts.

1. To enable forecast settings, only one `Column` and one `Value` field has to be included in your chart.

    ![Add Fields](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/forecastassigndata.png)

    Supported data types in Column field.    
    * Numeric
    * Numeric
    * DateTime
    * Date
    * Year
    * Quarter Year
    * Month Year
    * Week Year
    * Day Month Year
    * Month Day Year        

    Value field supports only `Numeric` type.

2. After adding column and value in the chart, the `Forecast Settings` option will get displayed in the `Properties` panel.

4. After enabling forecast, chart will be updated with forecast, upper and lower bound data points.

5. The following properties are used to configure forecast data points:

   `Length` can be used to define number of forecast data points to be included in chart, by default length will be set to 10.

   `Confidence Interval` can be used to define range for lower and upper bound values, by default confidence interval will be set to 95%.

   `Seasonality` is set to auto by default and it will be predicted automatically based on seasonal input data. If you want to set any seasonality period explicitly for your seasonal input data, then this option can be used. 

6. The following properties are used to customize forecast design:

    `Forecast` can be used to customize color of forecast line.

    `Confidence` can be used to customize color of upper and lower bound data points.

    `Confidence Band Style` can be used to define the display style of upper and lower bound data points.

    * `Fill` will display shaded color between upper and lower bound range.
    * `Line` will display upper and lower bound values with lines.
    * `Dot` will display upper and lower bound values with dotted lines.
