# Formatting Measure Type Column

The values in the Measure Type column can be formatted based on various options available:

**Type**

The display type of the measure column value can be determined by the type of data being displayed. For example, if you are displaying the sales amount column, then the type can be defined as `Currency`.

**Representation**

The format of the displayed value can be defined by the representation. For instance, by selecting thousands, the value 10,000 will be shown as 10K.

**Lakhs and Crores support**

Cultures from countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal offer support for Lakhs and Crores. For example, the value of 1,00,000 is displayed as 1L.

When the support culture is selected, there will be a checkbox that needs to be enabled to utilize lakhs and crores along with auto representation. This helps in managing existing values.

**Decimal places**

You have the option to set the decimal places explicitly when the representation is set with options other than `Auto`.
