# Period Over Period(PoP)

Period over Period support is used to compare measure values for one period of time against the results from a previous or subsequent period of time. The PoP widget is used to choose two different time periods at a time.

### Binding Fields
When binding a field to the PoP widget, default date ranges are calculated based on the bound field and set as a selected filter.

![default date range for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-defaultdaterange-denote.png)

The PoP widget is initially rendered with a default filter value that cannot be removed. Filters can only be reset to default if changes have been made. The default date range is determined by the number of days between the minimum and maximum dates of the bound field.

Users can select Relative/Custom date ranges using the `Relative Combobox` or `Calendars`, regardless of the bound field. The bound field is used for calculating default date ranges and for filtering purposes.

![popup dialog for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-popup.png)


Under the Date Range, the following relative items are displayed:

![date range relative items for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-daterange-relativeitems.png)

Under the Compare To, the following relative items are displayed:

![date range relative items for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-customrange-relativeitems.png)  

In both relative items Combobox, the `Custom` option will be automatically selected if a custom range is chosen from the calendar or entered manually in the `Combobox` input section.

> **IMPORTANT:**  
> * The PoP widget does not function as a slave for any widget.
> * The PoP widget always has a default value selected and filter values cannot be discarded.
> * No widget is automatically mapped as a slave to the PoP widget; required widgets must be configured manually.
> * Widgets acting as slaves for the PoP widget will only display their virtual measure in view mode.
> * Currently, PoP support is available for the Chart widget (excluding Bubble Scatter, Combo, and Radar Polar), Grid, and KPI card.



## How 'Compare To' relative items range calculated?

`Compare To` relative items value calculated dynamically based on the date range selection from `Date Range.` You can see how it calculated for each relative item:

1. `Previous Period`:

It is calculated based on the number of days between the selected dates(start and end) of `Date Range.` For example, consider the `Date Range` selected value as `1-Jan-2019 to 10-Jan-2019.` Here, the number of days between the selected dates is 10. So, the `Previous Period` value for the selected range is `22-Dec-2018 to 31-Dec-2018.`

2. `Previous Year`:

It is a previous year date of the selected date values from the `Date Range.` For example, consider the `Date Range` selected value as `1-Jan-2019 to 10-Jan-2019.` Here, the year of start and end date value is 2019. So, the `Previous Year` value for the selected range is `1-Jan-2018 to 10-Jan-2018.`


## How the PoP filtering works in Slave Widget?

Comparison types of charts like `Bar`, `Column`, `Stacked Bar`, `Stacked Column`, `100% Stacked Bar`, and `100% Stacked Column`. Distribution types of charts like `Line`, `Spline`, `Spline Area`, `Area`, `Stacked Area`, and `100% Stacked Area`. Proportional types of charts like `Pie`, `Doughnut`, `Pyramid`, and `Funnel` and `Grid` can be slave widgets for `Period Over Period` widget. `KPI Card` can also be a slave widget for `Period Over Period` widget, when only the `Actual Value` is configured in the card.

Consider that you have configured the `Column Chart`, `Grid`, and `KPICard`. You can make the `Column Chart`, `Grid`, and `KPICard` act as slaves for the `Period Over Period` widget by using the filter interaction window, as shown below.

![Chart as slave widget in filter configuration](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-slavewidget.png)

Upon configuration, the `Chart` color palette will change to the `PoP` selection colors (blue and green). The red information icon indicates that the chart virtual column value will not be displayed in design mode.

![chart color palette update for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-chartcolors.png)

Options to customize legend and palette for the virtual column will be available in Design, Preview, and View modes.

![chart custom legend for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-customlegend.png) 

The formatting category in the property panel will be displayed as shown below.

![chart color palette option for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-colorpalette.png) 

The stacked column chart will display colors under the formatting category.

![chart color palette option for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-colorpalettech.png) 

During interaction with the PoP widget, the chart will display two series. One series will have values filtered from the `Date Range`, and the other will contain filtered values from the `Compare To`.

**KPI card**

The `KPI Card` will be displayed with the following information. You can visualize its value in Preview or View Mode.

![KPI Card info update for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-kpicard.png)

During interaction with the PoP widget, the KPI Card will display two values. One value is filtered from the `Date Range` and is displayed as the `Actual Value`, while the other value contains the filtered value from `Compare To` and is displayed as the `Target Value`.

![period over period kpicard workflow](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-kpicardworkflow.png)

**Proportion chart**

Consider that you have configured the `Proportional Chart` as a slave for the `Period Over Period` widget. Like the column, bar, and line charts, the proportion chart's color palette will not be changed. The red information icon denotes that the comparison of period visualization will not be shown in the design mode.

![Proportion chart update in design mode](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-proportionalchart.png)

During interaction with the PoP widget, the proportional chart will display two series. One series shows values filtered from the `Date Range`, while the other series contains filtered values from the `Compare To`.

![Proportional chart as slave widget](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-proportional.png)

**Grid**

During interaction with the PoP widget, the grid will display two series for each column which are slaves to the PoP. One will have values filtered from the `Date Range`, while the other will contain filtered values from `Compare To`.

![period over period grid workflow](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-gridworkflow.png)

You can see a category to customize the POP settings and color palette for the grid which will be displayed in Design, Preview, or View Mode.

![Grid pop settings update for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-gridcolorpalette.png)

You can customize each column to be displayed in Design, Preview, or View Mode using the `Customize` option. If you click on the `Customize` option, a window will appear with a checkbox labeled `Act as Slave`. This helps us decide whether the column should act as a slave for the PoP or not.

![Grid pop settings update for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-gridcustomize.png)

Consider that you have configured two measure columns in the grid. For example, if you only want the `Freight` column to act as a slave for the PoP, uncheck the `Act as slave` checkbox for the `UnitsOnOrder` column and click `Ok` to update the changes.

![Grid Act as Slave setting update ](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/Actasslave-setting.png)

Now, the grid will render with the `Freight` column as a slave for the PoP as shown below.

![Grid render after Act as Slave update](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/grid-actasslave-for-pop.png)

In this POP settings window, by default, the `Secondary Value` is selected in the POP type.

![Grid default pop settings  update for period over period](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/Grid-secondaryvalue-setting.png)

Now, the grid will render as shown below with the secondary value.

![Grid render with secondary value](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/Grid-with-secondary.png)

For example, if you wish to display the absolute difference between the Actual and Target value, then click on the `POP Type` dropdown. You will see the following POP types. From this, you can select the `Absolute Difference` POP type according to your preference and click `Ok` to update the changes.

![Grid pop settings update for POP type](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/Grid-POPtypevalue.png)

Now, the grid will render as shown below with the `absolute difference` value.

![Grid render with Absolute difference value](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/Grid-with-differenceval.png)

If you require both primary and secondary values and wish to compare them, you can utilize the KPI column option of the grid. To observe the variation between the chosen range in the KPI, then navigate to the Column setting in the property panel and add the `KPI Expression` by clicking the `add icon`.

![Grid KPI setting for POP](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/KPI-addicon.png)

In this KPI Expression window, the following types are available in the Actual and Target Value.

![Grid  KPI setting Value type](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/KPI-valuetype.png)

You can change the Actual and Target value type as shown below.

![Grid  KPI setting Value selection](/static/assets/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/Pop-grid-KPIvalue.png)

Now, the grid will render as shown below with the KPI value.
