# Custom Widget

This section explains how to add user-defined widgets to the dashboard in release versions 4.1.36 or earlier and 4.2.68 or later.

[v4.2.68 or later](/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/custom-widget/v4.2.68-or-later/)

[v4.1.36 or below](/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/custom-widget/v4.1.36-or-below/)

[v5.2.48 or later](/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/custom-widget/v5.2.48-or-later/)

> **NOTE:** Custom widget folder placement has been changed in the v5.2.48 build. An utility has also been provided to migrate custom widgets created in a lower version of v4.2.68 to support the changes made in it. This feature is available in On-Premises Deployment but not in Syncfusion Managed Cloud Server.
