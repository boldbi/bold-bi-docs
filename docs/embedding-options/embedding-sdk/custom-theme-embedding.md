# Custom theme

Custom theme allows you to customize the appearance of the Bold BI embedded dashboard. Using the custom theme option, the dashboard can be customized with a variety of themes that are available on the Bold BI server.

> **NOTE:** To set custom theme, you should upload the custom theme files in Bold BI Server, please go through this [link](/site-administration/look-and-feel-settings-in-embedded-analytics/#custom-theme) for more details about uploading custom theme files.

## How to apply custom theme in Bold BI embedded application

Follow the steps to apply the custom theme to the dashboard in embedding.

## How to use Bold BI wrapper inside your html page

1. In your .html page, you need to add the following dependent script in the head tag of your page.

    ```js
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.boldbi.com/embedded-sdk/v6.7.11/boldbi-embed.js"></script>
    </head>
     ```

2. In the body tag, you need to create the div element with your own id name. This element will be used for dashboard embedding.

     ```js
    <body>
        <div id="dashboard_container"></div>
    </body>
     ```

3. In the body tag, you need to add the function to create BoldBI instance with following properties and call that function in the body using the `onload` attribute as follows. Also, call the `loadDashboard()` function.

    ### How to apply custom theme using appearance option 

    ```js
    <body onload="embedSample()">
        <div id="dashboard_container"></div>
        <script>
            function embedSample() {
                var boldbiEmbedInstance = BoldBI.create({
                    dashboardSettings :
                    {
                        themeSettings : {
                            appearance :"dark",//By default light theme would be set.
                            
                        }
                    }
                });
                boldbiEmbedInstance.loadDashboard();
            }
        </script>
    </body>
    ```    

    ### How to apply custom theme using application option

    When you set custom theme for `application` option, you have to set custom theme for `appearance` option too. otherwise `light` theme would be applied for `appearance` option.

    ```js
    <body onload="embedSample()">
        <div id="dashboard_container"></div>
        <script>
            function embedSample() {
                var boldbiEmbedInstance = BoldBI.create({
                    dashboardSettings :
                    {
                        themeSettings : {
                            appearance :"dark",
                            application : "darkviolet",//Need to mention the name under which you have saved the application theme file in Bold BI server.
                        }
                    }
                });
                boldbiEmbedInstance.loadDashboard();
            }
        </script>
    </body>
    ``` 

    ### How to apply custom theme using dashboard option

    When you set custom theme for `dashboard` option, you need not to set custom theme value for `appearance` and `application` options.

    ```js
    <body onload="embedSample()">
        <div id="dashboard_container"></div>
        <script>
            function embedSample() {
                var boldbiEmbedInstance = BoldBI.create({
                    dashboardSettings :
                    {
                        themeSettings : {
                            dashboard : "greenMist",// Need to mention the name under which you have saved the dashboard theme file in Bold BI server.
                        }
                    }
                });
                boldbiEmbedInstance.loadDashboard();
            }
        </script>
    </body>
    ``` 

Here the dashboard is rendered in dark theme as given in `appearance` option and application buttons, loading indicator are applied with darkviolet theme as specified in `application` option.

## How to refer the custom theme file as external in your embedded application

1. In your .html page of your application, you need to add `boldbi.theme.definition.min.css` as custom theme file and following dependent script in the head tag of your page.
 For demonstration we have set `dark` theme as custom theme.

     ```js
    <head>  
        <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.boldbi.com/embedded-sdk/v6.7.11/boldbi-embed.js"></script>
    </head>
     ```     

2. Need to set `isLocalTheme` option as `true` while referring the custom theme file as external.

     ```js
    <body onload="embedSample()">
        <div id="dashboard_container"></div>
        <script>
             function embedSample() {
            var boldbiEmbedInstance = BoldBI.create({
                dashboardSettings: {
                    themeSettings: {
                        isLocalTheme : true, //The default value is false.
                    }
                }
            });
            boldbiEmbedInstance.loadDashboard();
        }
        </script>
    </body>
     ```
