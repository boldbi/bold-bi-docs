# Embedded SDK Samples

The Embedded SDK is a JavaScript library that allows you to embed your BoldBI dashboards in various applications, such as ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core, Angular, and React. This embedding feature helps to reduce the amount of code and effort needed to embed the dashboards and widgets. Sample applications for ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, and Angular are available. You can download and embed your dashboards and widgets using the links provided.

> **NOTE:**  The best way to get started would be to read the [Getting Started](/getting-started/embedding-in-your-application/) section of the documentation first. The [Getting Started](/getting-started/embedding-in-your-application/) guide provides enough information that you need to know before working on the sample.
