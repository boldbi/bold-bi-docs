8. Fill the form as per the following instructions to complete the deployment steps.

    **Subscription**: Choose the subscription that you have with Azure. Learn more about subscriptions from [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/arunrakwal/2012/04/09/create-windows-azure-subscription/).

    **Resource group**: This is a logical group in Azure to group your resources like web app, storage account, network, etc. Learn more about resource groups [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups).

    **Location**: Choose the location where your app is planned to be deployed. “East US” is our recommended location.

    **Storage Type**: Bold BI Web App stores the resources either in File storage or in Blob storage. Choose a storage type for storing the files, which Report Server generates. A complete list of files generated by the Report Server can be viewed [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/bold-bi/on-premise/setup/application-startup#storage-type-1). (For upgrade Select File storage).

    **Web App name**: This is the name of the Bold BI App that you want to have in the URL. As this is going to be the URL, it should be unique globally. The deployment process will get failed if this is present already and you will need to start once again with another name.

    **Storage account name**: This is optional if you have chosen File storage in the Storage type and mandatory for Blob storage. This also must be unique as that of the Web App name. Learn more about storage accounts [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).

    **Storage account type**: This is optional if you have chosen File storage in the Storage type and mandatory for Blob storage. Learn more about storage account types [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/object-replication-overview).

    Click the agreement checkbox and click **purchase** to deploy the Bold BI web app. 

9. Bold BI Azure App service(web app) deployment gets started.

10. An app service plan has been created for the web app which will be in **Basic – B1** by default. Learn more about App service plans [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview). Bold BI web app does not support Free or Shared app service plans. Bold BI supports Basic, Standard, and Premium App Service plans in the Azure. The minimum recommended App Service plan to run the application is the Basic plan. To get better performance, can scale up the App Service plan from Basic to Standard or Premium plans. Please find the below documentation links on how to scale up and scale out the App Service plan.
