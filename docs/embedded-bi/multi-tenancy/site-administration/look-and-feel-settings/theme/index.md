# Theme

You can switch the application's theme from light to dark mode and vice versa using this option.
Additionally, you can customize the **text color**, **active state**, and **hover state background color**, and you can also customize components like **switches**, **radio buttons**, **check boxes**, and **numeric text boxes** by using **branding color**. In this theme option, the **dashboard theme** can also be customized.
   
## Switch Application Theme Mode

Application theme mode can be switched either to **light** or **dark mode**. By default, light mode is applied.

In light default mode, the application will be in light appearance with blue variant as branding color as shown in image below.
