# Creating a New Site in Bold BI Enterprise Edition

This section briefly explains the steps involved in creating a new site in Bold BI Enterprise multi-tenant application.

## Site creation

You can create another site in Bold BI Enterprise application by clicking the `Create Site` button in site management module.

This step holds the site details such as tenant type, name, domain, and identifier. The site identifier should be unique and it is a part of your site URL. You can create a site using custom domains too.

Based on branding chosen, following information will be copied to the tenant.
* Localization
* Date Format
* Time Format
* Branding Images.

 Otherwise, default images and values will be used for the tenant branding.

## Select database 

This step stores the dashboards, users, and their access permissions in SQL Server Database. You can connect to the existing SQL Server instance with the below options:

* By creating new `Bold Bi Site` database.

* By choosing one of the database from `Select a Database` drop down for creating Bold BI Server tables in that database.

## Select storage

You need to provide the storage type as either file storage or blob storage, in which Bold BI application will store the resources, contents, and logs.

### Isolation code

Isolation code feature is to configure a row-level security for site level to apply all dashboards on the site. Here, you can set the filter value in a specific column of data source. The UMS admin can apply the isolation code from site settings of the UMS site details page. The dashboard will be filtered based on the applied isolation code. If the column in the code does not match with the data source level, then no data will be displayed in widgets. Learn more from [here](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/configuring-isolation-code/).

### Custom attribute

This can be set by the UMS admin for a site in the site details page. Learn more from [here](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/configuring-custom-attribute/).

Attributes are name-value pairs that are associated with users, groups, and the sites (tenants).

![Configure Custom Attribute](/static/assets/embedded/multi-tenancy/images/custom-attribute.png#max-width=45%)

Name – Name of the attribute.

Value – Value of the attribute.

Description – Explaining the purpose for the attribute.

Encrypt – Store it as encrypted one in the database and the value will be shown as dots in the grid.

## Select administrator

This step is used to select the user to provide complete control over the site.

The selected users have the following permissions:
* [Create Dashboards](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-dashboards/open-dashboards/)
* [Create Data Sources](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-data-sources/)
* [Create Schedules](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-schedules/)
* [Create Slideshows](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-slideshows/)
* [Create Users](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-users/)
* [Create Groups](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-groups/)
* [Manage Permissions for users and groups](/embedded-bi/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/manage-permissions/)

After selecting the user, proceed with `Create and launch site`.
