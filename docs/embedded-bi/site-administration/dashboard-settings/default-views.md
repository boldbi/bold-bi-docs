# Default views for the dashboard

The dashboard can have many number of views and if the dashboard has to be rendered with any of its particular view by default, it can be achieved using the default views option.

## Steps to set the default view for the dashboard

The dashboard view can be set as default view in two ways:

1. [While saving the view](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-dashboards/manage-dashboard-views/#steps-to-add-a-dashboard-view) .
2. [From the views list of the dashboard](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-dashboards/manage-dashboard-views/#set-a-default-view-for-the-dashboard).

The following section explains how the default views are managed by administrator and remove the default views for the dashboard in the Bold BI.

## Administrator control over default view

If the administrator has enabled the `Default views` in the Dashboard Settings page, then the user can set the default views for the dashboard either while saving the dashboard views or from the dashboard views listing panel.
