# Embed Settings to generate Embed Secret key

This section explains on how to enable the embed authentication and generate the secret code in the Bold BI Server. 

## Get embed secret code

3. On clicking it, the secret code will be generated. Save the secret key safely, as it will not be able to retrieve or restore this generated secret.

4. Once the secret code is generated, it can be reset by clicking the `Reset Secret` button.

## Get common embed secret code from UMS

This common embed secret code would help you to embed the dashboard from multiple sites with the same embed secret code. If you reset the common embed secret code, it will break the previously working embedded dashboards in all the sites. 

1. Click the profile icon and select the `Manage sites(Admin access)` option, then it would open the UMS sites page in a new tab.
