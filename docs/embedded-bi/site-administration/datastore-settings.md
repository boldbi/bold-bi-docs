# Configure DataStore Settings

This section explains on how to configure the Data store settings for storing extracted data from data sources. 

DataStore is an intermediate database that is used to store imported data from web data sources and statistic files, there you will have a scheduled refresh option to update data.

## Database configuration

We can connect to the existing SQL Server instance with the below options

2. Existing Database

### New database

* In this method, we have to create a new database for storing the extracted data sources and files in it.  
* Select server type, enter the server instance name, credentials and select `New Database` option.  
* Enter your database name and click the `Save` button.
