# Integrations

The integrations settings page is divided into two sections: the `General` tab will list all webhooks which are created by all the users on the Bold BI site, and in the `Failure Logs` tab you can track the status of your webhook event calls from the Bold BI application.

[General](/embedded-bi/site-administration/integrations/webhook-listing/)

[Failure Logs](/embedded-bi/site-administration/integrations/failure-logs/)
