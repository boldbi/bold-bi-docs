> **IMPORTANT:** Do not remove the existing bindings. 

> **NOTE:**
> * If you have DNS, you can add binding for the DNS instead of IP mentioned here.
> * The IIS Express Development Certificate cannot be used to configure the SSL with the IP address or domain. If it is configured with an IP address or domain, Bold BI application will not function properly.
> * If you have a valid SSL certificate installed on the server machine for the respective domain, you can configure the bindings with "HTTPS" instead of "HTTP" when updating the new binding information.
