> **IMPORTANT:**  The applied customization will only be supported in the current version and this may not be reflected when you upgrade to the latest version of Bold BI Server. In this case, you may have to modify it at your end again. Also, we do highly not recommend the users to modify the login page UI elements as per your requirements. It has to be done as per your risk. Also, if any issues reported to the Bold BI support team, the team needs the customized files to reproduce the issue from our end to provide the resolution on it.
