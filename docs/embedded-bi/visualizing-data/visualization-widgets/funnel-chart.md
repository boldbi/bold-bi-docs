# Funnel Chart

The Funnel Chart control shows values across multiple stages in a process by highlighting different stages with different colors. It allows you to make proportional comparisons between values showcased in a progressively decreasing manner.

## How to configure table data in the Funnel Chart

The Funnel Chart needs a minimum of one value element and one column element to showcase. The measure or expression field that you want to analyze can be dropped into the Values block. The dimension for which you want to categorize the measure can be dropped into the Columns block. To categorize the measure based on a series, drop the respective dimension into the Rows block.

To configure data in the Funnel Chart, follow these steps:

1. Drag the Funnel Chart into the canvas and resize it to your required size.
