# Period Over Period(PoP)

Period over Period support used to compare measure values for one period of time against the results from a previous or subsequent period of time. PoP widget used to choose two different time periods at a time.

## How to configure table data to Period over Period?

1.  Drag and drop the `Period Over Period` from the toolbox at left into the design canvas and resize it to your required size.

8.  The data tab will be opened with available measures and dimensions from the connected data source.

9.  Drag and drop a date field from `Dimensions` into the `Columns` section.

### Binding Fields
On binding field to PoP widget, default date ranges calculated based on the bounded field and set as a selected filter.

![default date range for period over period](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-defaultdaterange-denote.png)

By default, the PoP widget renders with some default filter value and which can not be discarded. We allow only to reset the filters to default if we made changes. The default date range is calculated based on the days' pan between min and max dates of the bounded field.

You can select the Relative/Custom date ranges using the `Relative Combobox` or `Calendars.` We can select any date ranges irrespective of the bounded field. That field is used to calculate the default date ranges and filtering purposes.

![popup dialog for period over period](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-popup.png)


The following relative items are displayed under the Date Range:

![date range relative items for period over period](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-daterange-relativeitems.png)

The following relative items are displayed under the Compare To:

![date range relative items for period over period](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-customrange-relativeitems.png)  

In both relative items Combobox, the `Custom` will be selected automatically if you choose custom range from calendar or enter custom range manually using the `Combobox` input section.

> **IMPORTANT:**  
* PoP widget won't act as slave for any widget. 
* PoP always having some value selected by default it in. We can reset, but we can’t discard it’s filter values.
* No widget mapped as slave by default to PoP, we need to manually configure the required widgets as slave. 
* The widget acting as slave for PoP will display it’s virtual measure in view mode alone. 
* For now, PoP supported provided for Chart widget(except Combo and Radar Polar) alone.



## How 'Compare To' relative items range calculated?

`Compare To` relative items value calculated dynamically based on the date range selection from `Date Range.` You can see how it calculated for each relative item:

1. `Previous Period`:

It is calculated based on the number of days between the selected dates(start and end) of `Date Range.` For example, consider the `Date Range` selected value as `1-Jan-2019 to 10-Jan-2019.` Here, the number of days between the selected dates is 10. So, the `Previous Period` value for the selected range is `22-Dec-2018 to 31-Dec-2018.`

2. `Previous Year`:

It is a previous year date of the selected date values from the `Date Range.` For example, consider the `Date Range` selected value as `1-Jan-2019 to 10-Jan-2019.` Here, the year of start and end date value is 2019. So, the `Previous Year` value for the selected range is `1-Jan-2018 to 10-Jan-2018.`


## How the PoP filtering works in Slave Widget?

Comparison types of charts like `Bar,` `Column,` `Stacked Bar,` `Stacked Column,` `100% Stacked Bar,` and `100% Stacked Column.` Distribution types of charts `Line,` `Spline,` `Spline Area,` `Area,` `Stacked Area,` and `100% Stacked Area.` Proportional types of charts `Pie,` `Doughnut,` `Pyramid,` and `Funnel` can be slave widgets for `Period Over Period.`

Consider you configured `Column chart.` You can change the `Column Chart` as a slave for the `Period Over Period` widget by using the filter interaction window as shown below.

![Chart as slave widget in filter configuration](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-slavewidget.png)

Once you configured, the `Chart` color palette will be changed using the `PoP` selection colors(blue and green). The red information icon denotes that the chart virtual column value will not get a display in the design mode.

![chart color palette update for period over period](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-chartcolors.png)

Similarly, you can see an option to customize legend and palette for the virtual column which will be displayed in the Designer Preview/View Mode.

![chart color palette option for period over period](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-colorpalettech.png) 

During interaction from the PoP widget, the chart will display two series. One having values filtered from `Date Range` and another one contains filtered values from `Compare To.`

Please find the response of different type of charts as slave for PoP widgets.

**Bar Chart**

**Line Chart**

**Area Chart**

**Spline Chart**

**Spline Area Chart**

**Stacked column Chart**

**Percent Stacked bar chart**

![Percent Stacked bar chart as slave widget](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-percentchartslave.png)

Consider you have configured the `Proportional Chart` as a slave for the `Period Over Period` widget. Like the column, the line chart's color palette will not be changed. The Red information icon denotes that the comparison of period visualization will not be shown in the design mode.

![Proportion chart update in design mode](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pop/pop-proportionalchart.png)

During the interaction of Pop Widget, the proportional chart will display two series. One shows values filtered from `Date Range` another one contains filtered values from `Compare To.`
