# Configuring Pivot Grid

Pivot grid allows you to display summarized data in cross tabular format i.e., in rows and columns.

![pivot-grid](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_demo.png)

## How to configure table data to pivot grid?

> **NOTE:** Before adding the card widget to the design layout, make sure to create the data source. You can refer to [this section](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/creating-a-new-data-source/) to learn how to create a new data source. 

Pivot grid need a minimum of 1 value , 1 row and 1 column element to showcase proper pivot table details. The measure or expression field that you would like to analyze can be dropped into `Value(s)` field. The dimension that you would like to categorize the measure based on row and column can be dropped in `Row(s)` and `Column(s)` field.

Follow the steps to configure data to Pivot grid

Drag and drop the pivot grid widget into canvas and resize it to your required size

![pivot-grid_dragDrop](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_dragDrop.png)

To open Property pane, click `Properties` icon in Configuration panel, .

![configurationPanel_propertyIcon](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/configurationPanel_propertyIcon.png)

Or click `Properties` icon from widget's top right corner

![pivot-grid_propertyIcon](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_propertyIcon.png)

In property pane switch to `ASSIGN DATA` tab from `PROPERTIES`, to assign data to pivot grid data fields.

![pivot-grid_properties](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_properties.png)

The data tab will be opened with available measures and dimensions from the connected data source. Also it contains `Value(s)`, `Row(s)` and `Column(s)` field as mentioned earlier,

![pivot-grid_assignData](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_assignData.png)

**Adding data to Value(s) field**

You can add more than one `Measures` into `Value(s)` field by drag and drop the required measure.

![pivot-grid_bindValue](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_bindValue.png)


Now the pivot grid will be rendered like this for single data

![pivot-grid_valueRender](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_valueRender.png)

Pivot grid will be rendered like this, if more than one data bind to `Value(s)`

![pivot-grid_valueMultiRender](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_valueMultiRender.png)

If more than one data is added to `Value(s)` field and then grid column is separated based on the number of data attached to `Value(s)` field, as shown in above image.

Click the `Settings` option to change required summary type from the available summary types shown in `Settings`.

![pivot-grid_valueSettingIcon](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_valueSettingIcon.png)


You can filter the data to be displayed in pivot grid by using filter. For more details, refer [filter](/embedded-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/configuring-widget-filters/).

![pivot-grid_valueSettingFilter](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_valueSettingFilter.png)

You can format the data to be displayed in the pivot grid by using format option. For more details, refer [measure format](/embedded-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/formatting-measure-type-column/)

![pivot-grid_valueSettingFormat](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_valueSettingFormat.png)


You can add more than one column from `Dimensions` field into `Value(s)` field.

**Adding Column(s)**

Adding single data to `Value(s)` and `Column(s)`

![pivot-grid_singleValuesColumn](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_singleValuesColumn.png)


You can change the `Settings`.

![Settings](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/Settings.png)

You can `Sort` the dimension data using `Sort` option under `Settings` menu list. To apply sorting for the data, refer [Sort](/embedded-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/advanced-sorting/#dimension-column).

![Sort Settings](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/sortdimension.png)

You can apply filters by selecting filter in settings. For more details, refer [filter](/embedded-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/configuring-widget-filters/#configuring-filter-for-dimension-column).

![Configuring widget filters](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/configuring-widget-filters.png)


Similarly you can add the `Measures` and `Expressions` into columns field.

**Adding Row(s)**

You can drag and drop the `Measure` or `Dimension` into the `Row(s)` field. 

![pivot-grid_rowData](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_rowData.png)

You can apply [filter](/embedded-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/configuring-widget-filters/#configuring-filter-for-dimension-column) and [sort](/embedded-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/advanced-sorting/#dimension-column) option for the rows field, if required.

**Adding Multiple Column(s)**

If more than one data is added to `Column(s)` field and then the arrow icon or node is prepended to each cell of the column header. A new tree view list will be opened when the arrow icon is clicked.

Adding Multiple data to `Column(s)` with single `Value(s)` and `Row(s)`

![pivot-grid_multipleColumn](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid_multipleColumn.png)


**Adding Multiple Row(s)**

If more than one data is added to `Row(s)` field and then the arrow icon or node is prepended to each cell of the row header. A new tree view list will be opened when the arrow icon is clicked.

Adding Multiple data to `Row(s)` with single `Value(s)` and `Column(s)`
