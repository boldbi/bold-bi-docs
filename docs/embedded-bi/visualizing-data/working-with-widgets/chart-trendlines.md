# Trendlines

Trendline helps to know the general pattern or overall direction of the data in the chart widget. You can add more than one trendline to Cartesian charts except bar type series (Line, Column, Area, Spline) and stacked type of charts. You can add, edit, and delete trendlines. 

## Add and edit trendline

1. You can see the trendlines option under the `properties` tab of the applicable chart widgets.
