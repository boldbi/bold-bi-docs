## Open Dashboard Views
Dashboard Views are opened in our embedded Dashboard Viewer itself as Dashboards.
		
## Add Dashboard Views
* If the user has `Read Specific Dashboards` permission, then the user can create Dashboard Views in that dashboard.
* The created Dashboard Views cannot be updated/deleted by other users.
* The owner of the Dashboard View only has share permission on the Dashboard View.
* The shared Dashboard Views can be modified and saved as another view as the users cannot modify the actual ones.  

### Steps to add a Dashboard View

1. Filters applied in the dashboards are summarized in the `Filter Overview` section under `Applied Filters`.

    To save the filters, click on `Save` icon, a popup is opened to type the name for the Dashboard View and submit it.
