# Manage Users in the Bold BI

This section explains how to add, edit, activate, deactivate, delete users and also to manage the permissions and assign users to groups in the Bold BI.

Users can only be added/edited/deleted by the users, belonging to the `System Administrator` group.

## Add new users

New users can be added to the Bold BI individually or in bulk using CSV import

### Add individual users

To add new users to the Bold BI, click `New User` and then `Add User` from the User Management page. 

The `Add User` dialog will be shown as like in the image below.

![Add User](/static/assets/embedded/managing-resources/manage-users/images/add-user.png)

Fill the form with email address, username, first name, and last name(optional) and click `Add`.  

> **NOTE:** An email address is mandatory only in [Email required](/embedded-bi/site-administration/account-settings/#email-required) mode.

New account will be created for the user and an account activation email will be sent to the email address with activation link to activate the Bold BI account.

The activation link sent to the user will be valid only for 2 days and if the user have not activated within the 2 days, a new activation link can be sent to the user from the user edit page. Check [Activate Users](#activate-users) section for more details.

The account will be in inactive status till the user activates the account from the activation email.

### Add individual users with password

To add users with the password, you have to set the Account Activation Mode to `Automatic` in the `Accounts` settings page.

The password must meet the following requirements:

It must contains,

### Import users from CSV

You can navigate to the user management page by clicking the `User Management` dropdown under the `Admin` menu as follows.
