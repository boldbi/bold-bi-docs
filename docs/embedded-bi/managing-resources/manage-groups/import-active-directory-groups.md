# Active Directory Group Import

This section explains how to search and import groups from Active Directory into the Bold BI application.

> **NOTE:**  Active Directory connection has to be configured in the [Active Directory Settings](/embedded-bi/site-administration/active-directory/) in the `General` page for importing groups.

Users belonging to the `System Administrator` group only can import Active Directory groups into the Bold BI application.

## Search Groups

You can search the Active Directory groups for any one of the following properties and select them to import into the Bold BI application.

* Group name
* Group description

A maximum of 1000 groups will be searched and pulled from Active Directory in a single request. 

Bold BI Server will search the groups within the specified distinguished name given in the Active Directory settings page and list the search results in the grid.

## Import Groups

To import the Active Directory groups into the Bold BI application, you have to choose the groups from the list and click `Import groups` at the top right corner.

Bold BI Server will import the chosen groups and a confirmation message will be displayed.

The success message box explains which users were imported and not imported into the Bold BI application.

## Duplicate Groups

Active Directory groups who has the same group name as that of the Bold BI application groups (which are already present) will be marked as duplicate groups and will not be allowed to import into the Bold BI application.
