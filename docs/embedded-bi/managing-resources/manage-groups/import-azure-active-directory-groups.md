# Azure Active Directory Group Import

This section explain how to search and import groups from Azure Active Directory into the Bold BI.

> **NOTE:**  Azure Active Directory connection has to be configured in the [Azure Active Directory Settings](/embedded-bi/site-administration/azure-active-directory/) in the `General` page for importing groups.

Users belonging to the `System Administrator` group only can import Azure Active Directory groups into the Bold BI.

## Search Groups

Initially, any Active Directory groups cannot be displayed by searching for the group.

You can search the Azure Active Directory groups with any one of the below properties and choose them to import into Bold BI.

* Group name

A maximum of 1000 groups will be searched and pulled from Azure Active Directory in a single request. 

Bold BI will list the search results of the groups in the grid as shown in the following image.

The success message box explains about the imported and not imported users into the Bold BI.

## Duplicate Groups

Azure Active Directory groups who has the same group name as that of the Bold BI groups(which are already present) will be marked as duplicate groups and will not be allowed to import into Bold BI.
