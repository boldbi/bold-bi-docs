> **NOTE:**  Before you import an OpenID group, first you need to configure the `Group Import settings` in authentication settings page. Refer this link [how to configure OpenID Authorization Settings](/embedded-bi/site-administration/sso/openid-support/). 

## Import groups

To import the OpenID connect groups, you can use the both Dashboard Server and User Management Servers authentication provider. Choose the provider from the drop-down list at the top left corner.
