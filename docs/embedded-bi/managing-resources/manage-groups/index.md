# Manage Groups

This section explains on how to add, edit, delete groups and also on how to assign users and manage permissions to groups in the Bold BI Embedded.

Groups is a collection of users to which permissions can be assigned.

New groups can be added by providing name and description(optional) for the group.

Fill the form with name and description and click on `Add`. New group will be created and you can [add users](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-groups/#assign-users) or [manage permissions](/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-groups/#manage-permissions) for it.

## Edit group
Group Information can be edited from the group's edit page.
