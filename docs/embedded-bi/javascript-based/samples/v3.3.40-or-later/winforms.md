# Bold BI Dashboards embedding in Windows Forms using Embedded SDK

We have created a Windows Forms application for achieving this embedding. Here, we could set the server and dashboard details as the embed details then the dashboard would be rendered after passing the authorization.  

> **NOTE:** The best way to get started would be reading the [Getting Started](/embedded-bi/javascript-based/getting-started/) section of the documentation to start using first. The [Getting Started](/embedded-bi/javascript-based/getting-started/) guide gives you enough information that you need to know before working on the sample.      

## How to run the sample

1. Please download the Windows Forms sample from [here](https://onpremise-demo.boldbi.com/getting-started/windows-forms-v3.3/sample.zip).    

2. You need to set your embed property details in `EmbedProperties.cs`.

<meta charset="utf-8"/>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td align="left">RootUrl</td>
        <td align="left">Dashboard Server BI URL (ex: http://localhost:5000/bi/site/site1, http://demo.boldbi.com/bi/site/site1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="left">SiteIdentifier</td>
        <td align="left">For Bold BI Enterprise edition, it should be like `site/site1`. For Bold BI Cloud, it should be empty string.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="left">Environment</td>
        <td align="left">Your Bold BI application environment. (If Cloud, you should use `Cloud`, if  Enterprise, you should use `OnPremise`)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="left">DashboardId</td>
        <td align="left">Set the item id of the dashboard to embed from BI server.</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="left">UserEmail</td>
        <td align="left">UserEmail of the Admin in your Bold BI, which would be used to authorize the server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="left">EmbedSecret</td>
        <td align="left">You could get your EmbedSecret key from Embed tab by enabling `Enable embed authentication` in Administration page as mentioned in next step</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


3. You could get the item id of the dashboard from the BI server. Please refer to this [link](/embedded-bi/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/get-dashboard-link/#get-link) and the following screenshot.

4. You can get your Embed Secret key from the administrator setting section. Please refer to this [link](/embedded-bi/site-administration/embed-settings/) for more details.  

5. Then, run your Windows Forms sample.

## How this sample works

1. Based on the dashboardId provided in the embed properties, we would authorize the server URL by calling the GetEmbedDetails function.

2. In the above authorization, we have generated the SignatureUrl with the provided EmbedSecret key and validate the embed details in Bold BI. Once details are validated, the dashboard starts to render.

3. In the `EmbedProperties.cs`, you can change the dashboard Id of the respective dashboard as you wish to embed.
