## Connect to QuickBooks Payments
### Create a QuickBooks Payments data source
After the successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel will open. Follow these steps to create a QuickBooks Payments data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Click the **API Endpoints** down dropbox and choose the required endpoint.
3. Click the **Custom URL**, to enter the URL manually. Refer to the [QuickBooks Payments API documentation](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/api/accounting/all-entities/account) for more details.
4. Select the **GET** method for the REST API in the **Method** combo box.
5. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the QuickBooks Payments data source. This value is used to fetch the data from the QuickBooks Payments data source using pagination.
6. Choose a time interval for the **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
7. Select the **JSON** data type in the **Data Format** combo box.
8. The authentication type will be set to the **QuickBooks Payments** automatically since the OAuth is used for authenticating with QuickBooks Payments account.

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Data Formats 
</td>
<td>
By default, the data is retrieved in the <i>JSON</i> format. Additionally, <i>XML</i> is supported in QuickBooks Payments.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

1. For instance, to query about the account, query the <i>/Get bank account</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed information, you can get the ID of the specific account.

Replace it in the URL to query a particular account:

   `https://api.intuit.com/quickbooks/v4/customers/<:id>/bank-accounts/<:bankaccount_id>`

### Sample queries
**Get all bank accounts associated with a customer**

   `https://api.intuit.com/quickbooks/v4/customers/<:id>/bank-accounts`

**Get all cards associated with a customer**

   `https://api.intuit.com/quickbooks/v4/customers/<:id>/cards`

### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect**, to connect with the configurations set.
* The Choose Schema(s) dialog opens. The schema represents the key fields of JSON data retrieved from the QuickBooks Payments Rest API request. This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and its corresponding values in the grid for preview. Select the required schema(s) from the treeview to use in the designer and click **Connect**.
