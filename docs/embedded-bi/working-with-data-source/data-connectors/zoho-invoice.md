## Authentication with Zoho Invoice
Use the following steps to authenticate with the Zoho Invoice web service:

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your Zoho Invoice account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by the Bold BI dashboards. 
> **NOTE:**  If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.
3. Set a name to identify the account and click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect using the already connected account, refer to the [Connected Accounts](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/zoho-invoice/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

     > **NOTE:**  To connect with a new account click **Connect New Account**.

## Create a Zoho Invoice data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow these steps to create a Zoho Invoice data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Click the **Endpoints** down drop box and choose the required endpoint.
3. Click **Custom Url** to enter the URL manually. Refer to the [Zoho Invoice API documentation](https://www.zoho.com/invoice/api/v3/#introduction) for more details.
4. Select the **GET** method for the REST API in the **Method** combo box.
5. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the Zoho Invoice data source. This value is used to fetch the data from the Zoho Invoice data source using pagination.
6. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with your dashboard.  
7. Select the **JSON** data type in the **Data Format** combo box.
8. The authentication type will be set to the **Zoho Invoice** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with the Zoho Invoice account.

You can also edit the connection information set using the [Edit Connection](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.


#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL

1. For instance, to get the specific invoice details, query the <i>/Show Invoice</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed information, get the id of the specific invoice.

Replace it in the URL to query particular invoice:

`https://invoice.zoho.com/api/v3/invoices/<:invoice_id>`

### Sample queries

**All Invoices**

`https://invoice.zoho.com/api/v3/invoices`

**All Credit Notes**

`https://invoice.zoho.com/api/v3/creditnotes`


### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.
* The Choose Schema(s) dialog opens. The schema represents the key fields of JSON data retrieved from the Zoho Invoice Rest API request. This dialog displays a list of schemas in the treeview and its corresponding values in the grid for preview. Select required schema(s) from the treeview to use in designer and click **Connect**.
