# Connecting to Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services(SSAS) data source
Bold BI supports connecting Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) database using the SQL MDX Query (C# API).

## Choose a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) data source
To configure the Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) data source, follow these steps:
1. Click the **Data Sources** button in the configuration panel to add a new data connection.

   ![Data source icon](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/common/DataSourcesIcon.png)

2. Click **CREATE NEW** to launch a new connection from the connection panel.
3. Select the **Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services** connection in the connection panel.

   ![Choose data source](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/ssas/ChooseDS.png)

> **NOTE:**  You can also create a data source from the home page by clicking the **Data Sources** menu from left menu panel and **Create Data Source** from the data sources page.

## Connect to Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)
### Create a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) data source
After clicking the data source, the **NEW DATA SOURCE** configuration panel opens.
Follow the given steps to create a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) data source:
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid SSAS server (Syncfusion supports both multi-dimensional tabular mode connection) or host name in the **Server name** text box.
3. Choose **None**, **Windows Authentication**, or **Server Authentication** in Authentication Mechanism combo box.
4. Enter a valid SSAS server username and password, if you choose Server Authentication Mechanism.
5. Select the database you want to query in the listed database associated with the given SSAS Server in **Database** combo box.

In future, you can edit the connection information using the [Edit Connection](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

### Cube customization
> **IMPORTANT:**  Code view and join operation is not supported and the buttons are always in disable state. And data preview is also not supported for the dragged cube.

1. Click **Connect** to connect the SSAS server with configured details. 
The available Cubes list is shown in treeview for the selected database that are retrieved from the SSAS server.

   ![Treeview schema](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/ssas/Treeview_schema.png)

2. In the data design view page, drag and drop the cube.

3. Syncfusion only supports String to Date conversion. You can convert the string to date format and then use this column in the filter and widget operations.

4. Click **Save** to save the data source with a relevant name.

## Connect to expression designer
Expression designer is used to create a calculated field or column based on the field(s) or column(s) in selected cube(s).

   ![Expression Designer](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/ssas/Expression_dialog.png)

### Supported expression list

   <table>
   <tr>
   <th>Function Type</th>
   <th>Function Name</th>
   </tr>
   <td>Numbers</td>
   <td>ABS, ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, COS, DEGREES, EXP, LOG, PI, POWER, RADIAN, ROUND, SIGN, SIN, SQRT, TAN</td>
   <tr>
   <td>Aggregation</td>
   <td>AVG, COUNT, COUNTD, MAX, MIN, STDEV, SUM, VAR</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Logical</td>
   <td>AND, OR, NOT</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Conditional</td>
   <td>IF, IFNULL, ISNULL, ISNOTNULL</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Date</td>
   <td>NOW, DATESUB, DATEADD, TODAY</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>String</td>
   <td>CHAR, LEN, LEFT, RIGHT, LTRIM, RTRIM</td>
   </tr>
   </table>

## Query filters or Initial filters 
Query filters can be used to filter data for the created data source. For example, if you want to create a data source to show share market data only for year 2018, then you can use this filter.

   ![Query filters](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/ssas/Filter_Dialog.png)

You can configure filter by dragging the required columns to right side canvas.

## Connecting through MDX query

You can connect to the data source of certain data connections through custom MDX Query.
By default, the data design view opens with the design view. Switch to the code view by enabling the toggle option in the tools pane in the data design view as shown in the following image.
   
   ![Code view toggle](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/ssas/code-view-toggle.png)
   
This will open the query editor window as follows.
   
   ![Query editor window](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/ssas/query-editor-window.png)
 
In the Query Editor Window, you can enter the **MDX** Query which helps to access table schema information. After entering your query, click the `Run` button in the tools pane. 
   
   ![MDX query](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/ssas/mdx-query.png)
 
You can also view the data for your query at bottom of the Query Editor by clicking `Update`.

> **Notes:**  We have provided the code view mode support in SQL Server Analysis Services using subselects.  <br />
Subselects have the following Limitation:  <br />
•	Usage of **“WITH”** and **“DAX”** queries is restricted and will be provided in the future through extract mode.  <br />
•	The **WHERE** clause does not filter the subspace.  <br />
•	The **WHERE** clause changes the default member in the sub-cube only.  <br />
•	The **NON-EMPTY** clause is not allowed in an axis clause; use a filter (MDX) function expression instead.  <br />
•	The **HAVING** clause is not allowed in an axis clause. Use a filter (MDX) function expression instead.  <br />
