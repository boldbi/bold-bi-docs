There are two connection types available in a data source:

	* Live mode
	* Extract mode

## Live mode connection

In this connection type, a data source is directly fetched from source. Choose the **Live** mode option for this connection.

### Data Preview
1. Click **Connect** to connect the Amazon Aurora server with configured details. 
The schema represents the collection list retrieved from the Amazon Aurora server. This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and their corresponding values.

   ![Treeview schema](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/common/Treeview_schema.png)

2. Now, the data design view page with the selected table schema opens. Drag and drop the table.

   ![Query designer](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/common/QueryEditor_sql.png)

    You can use the Code View options for passing query to display data.

2. The Choose Table(s) dialog opens. This dialog displays a list of tables and views in treeview. Select the required table(s) or view(s) from treeview to use in the designer.
The option is available for configuring incremental refresh column (The table must have a primary key column and date column to configure this option) for the selected items in the right side panel. If you configured it, then the data source will work on [Incremental update](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/sql-data-source/#incremental-update), otherwise works on [Full load](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/sql-data-source/#full-load) concept.
