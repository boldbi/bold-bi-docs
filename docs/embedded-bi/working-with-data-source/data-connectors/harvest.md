## Create Harvest data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Harvest data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid Harvest REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Harvest API documentation](https://help.getharvest.com/api-v2/) for more details.

    Example: [https://&lt;:your_sub_domain&gt;.harvestapp.com/projects.json](https://%3c:your_sub_domain%3e.harvestapp.com/projects.json)    

3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the harvest data source. This value is used to fetch the data from harvest data source via pagination.
5. Replace your **Access Token** and **Account Id** in the headers.
6. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
7. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
8. Choose one of the **Authentication Type** from the dropdown.
9. To connect based on the chosen Authentication, refer [Supported Authentication Types based on version APIs](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/harvest/#authentication-for-harvest).
