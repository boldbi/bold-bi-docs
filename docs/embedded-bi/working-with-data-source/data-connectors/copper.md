## Create Copper data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Copper data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Click the **Api EndPoints** drop-down box and choose the required endpoint.
3. Click the **Custom Url** if you want to enter the URL manually. Refer the [Copper API documentation](https://developer.copper.com/?version=latest) for more details.
4. Select **POST** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
5. Select either *Parameter(s)* or *Raw* under **Request Body**. Set *page_size* as key and set your page size value.

7. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the FreshworkCRM data source. This value is used to fetch the data from FreshworkCRM data source via pagination.
8. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
9. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
10. Choose **None** under **Authentication Type**.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL

1. For instance, to get the specific task details, query the <i>/tasks/search</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed information get the ID of the specific task.

> **NOTE:**  To get the specific task detail, set the **Method Type** as *GET*. Set Method Type based on endpoint. 

Replace it in the URL to query a particular payment:

[https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/tasks/&lt;:task_id&gt;](https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/tasks/%3c:task_id%3e)

### Sample queries
**List Contact Types**

[https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/contact_types](https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/contact_types)

**List Lead Statuses**
