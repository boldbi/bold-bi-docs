## Create Zendesk data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Zendesk data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid Zendesk REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Zendesk API documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/zendesk-apis/resources) for more details.

    Example: `https://<:yourdomainname>.zendesk.com/api/v2/<:your_endpoint>`    

3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the Zendesk data source. This value is used to fetch the data from Zendesk data source via pagination.
5. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
6. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
7. Choose one of the **Authentication Type** from the dropdown.
8. To connect based on the chosen Authentication, refer [Supported Authentication Types](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/zendesk/#authentication-for-zendesk).

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL

1. Query the <i>/tickets.json</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed information, get the ID of the specific ticket.

Replace it in the URL to query a particular ticket:

`[https://domain_name.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/12.json`

### Sample queries
**Tickets**

`https://syncdb.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets.json`

**Workspaces**

`https://syncdb.zendesk.com/api/v2/workspaces.json`

**Groups**
