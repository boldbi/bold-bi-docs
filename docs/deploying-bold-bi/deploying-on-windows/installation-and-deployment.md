If you didn't install the client libraries during this installation, you can do so later using the `ClientLibrary.msi` setup after installing the Bold BI setup. Follow these steps to install the client libraries:

1.	Navigate to the location `C:\Program Files (x86)\Bold BI Enterprise Edition\Client Library` and double-click the setup file named `ClientLibrary.msi`.
