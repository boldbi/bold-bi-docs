For manual installation of the Chromium Packages, refer to [this guide](https://support.boldbi.com/kb/article/16581/how-to-install-chromium-packages-manually).

## Client libraries

> **IMPORTANT:** Bold BI Enterprise Edition uses client libraries such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, and MongoDB to connect with their respective SQL database variants. Review and accept the license for each library to consent to its installation. Only the selected client libraries installed.

If you didn't install the client libraries during this installation, you can do so later using the `ClientLibrary.msi` setup after installing the Bold BI setup. Follow these steps to install the client libraries:

1.	Navigate to the location `C:\Program Files (x86)\Bold BI Enterprise Edition\Client Library` and double-click the setup file named `ClientLibrary.msi`.
