# Install Optional Libraries 

## Client libraries

> **IMPORTANT:** Bold BI Enterprise Edition utilizes client libraries such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, and MongoDB to establish connections with their respective SQL database variants. To install the client libraries, you must read and accept the license agreement for each library.

1. Go to the client library location:
    ```cmd
    cd /var/www/bold-services/clientlibrary/
    ```
2. In this location, you will find the client library consent document named `consent-to-deploy-client-libraries.txt`. Read the client libraries `LICENSE` details and execute the following command to install the client libraries:
    ```cmd
    $sudo bash install-optional.libs.sh install-optional-libs npgsql,mongodb,influxdb,snowflake,mysql,oracle
    ```

> **NOTE:** If you encounter any issues in the designer, please execute the following command: </br>
  ```cmd
  sudo chown -R <current user name> /var/www/boldbi-embedded/boldbi/bi/dataservice
  ```

## PhantomJS

> **IMPORTANT:** PhantomJS is a headless WebKit scriptable with JavaScript. It is free software or open-source and may contain MIT, BSD, LGPL, GPL, or other similar licenses that include third-party code. This executable file is necessary to enable the image and PDF export functionalities in the dashboard and widgets. Without this file, the image and PDF export options will no longer be available in the dashboard and widgets. 

1. Go to the client library location:
    ```cmd
    cd /var/www/bold-services/clientlibrary/
    ```
 
2. Create a directory named `bi/dataservice` inside the directory `/var/www/boldbi-embedded/boldbi/app_data/` by executing the following command:
    ```cmd
    $sudo mkdir -p /var/www/boldbi-embedded/boldbi/app_data/bi/dataservice
    ```

3. In this location, you will find the PhantomJS library consent document named `consent-to-deploy-phantomjs-webkit.txt`. Read the PhantomJS `LICENSE` details and execute the following command to install PhantomJS:
    ```cmd
    $sudo bash install-optional.libs.sh install-optional-libs phantomjs
    ```

> **NOTE:** : PhantomJS requires certain dependencies. If your distribution does not include these dependencies, please install them from the following link: [PhantomJS Download](https://phantomjs.org/download.html).
