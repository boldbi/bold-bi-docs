    ~~~

7.	You can install the Bold BI Enterprise Edition installer in two ways.

     a. [Configuring the application startup details during the installation](#configuring-the-application-startup-details-during-the-installation)

     b. [Silent installation alone without providing the application startup details](#silent-installation-alone-without-providing-the-application-startup-details)

### Configuring the application startup details during the installation

If you need to set the application configuration details during the setup installation itself, you can use this parameter list.

Once the setup installation is completed, your application will be configured by default, and you can proceed to use the Bold BI dashboards.

Download the [v2_application_startup](https://github.com/boldbi/api-payload/blob/main/v2/application_startup.json) JSON file and provide all the necessary inputs. After providing your inputs in the file, pass it to the installer as an argument.

### Silent installation alone without providing the application startup details

If you donâ€™t want to provide the application startup configuration details during the silent installation, then set **IsSilentStartUp** to **false** and proceed with the installation.

![Silent-startUp-false](/static/assets/installation-and-deployment/images/silent-startup-false.png)

**Example,**

![Command-line-startUp-false](/static/assets/installation-and-deployment/images/command-line-startup-false.png)

Once the setup installation is completed, you can provide the startup details in the Bold BI application itself and configure it. Refer to the following [link](/application-startup/latest/) for more information on application startup.
