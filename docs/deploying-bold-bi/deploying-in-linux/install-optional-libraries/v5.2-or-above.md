# Install Optional Libraries

## Client libraries

> **IMPORTANT:** Bold BI Enterprise Edition utilizes client libraries such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, and MongoDB to establish connections with their respective SQL database variants. To install the client libraries, you must read and accept the license agreement for each library.

1. Go to the client library location:
    ```cmd
    cd /var/www/bold-services/clientlibrary/
    ```

2. You will see the client library consent document <b>consent-to-deploy-client-libraries.txt</b>. Read the client libraries <b>LICENSE</b> details and execute the following steps to install client libraries:
    ```cmd
    $sudo bash install-optional.libs.sh install-optional-libs mongodb,influxdb,snowflake,mysql,oracle,google,clickhouse
    ```

 > **NOTE:** If you face any issues in the designer, please execute the following command: </br>
  ```cmd
  sudo chown -R <current user name> /var/www/bold-services/application/bi/dataservice
  ```
