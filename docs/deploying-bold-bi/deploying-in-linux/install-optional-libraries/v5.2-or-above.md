 `/var/www/bold-services/clientlibrary/`

2. You will see the client library consent document <b>consent-to-deploy-client-libraries.txt</b>. Read client libraries <b>LICENSE</b> details and execute the following steps to install client libraries:

  ~~~js
    $sudo bash install-optional.libs.sh install-optional-libs mongodb,influxdb,snowflake,mysql,oracle,google,clickhouse
  ~~~
