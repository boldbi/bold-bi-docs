## Client libraries

> **IMPORTANT:** Bold BI Enterprise Edition uses client libraries such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, and MongoDB to connect with their respective SQL database variants. You need to read and accept client library license to install client libraries. 

1. Go to client library location. 
   ```cmd
   cd /var/www/bold-services/clientlibrary/
   ```
2. You will see client library consent document <b>consent-to-deploy-client-libraries.txt</b>. Read client  libraries <b>LICENSE</b> details and execute the following steps to install client libraries.
 
   ~~~js
    $sudo bash install-optional.libs.sh install-optional-libs npgsql,mongodb,influxdb,snowflake,mysql,oracle
   ~~~

 > **NOTE:** If you face any issues in the designer, please execute the following command. </br>

  ~~~js
    sudo chown -R <current user name> /var/www/bold-services/application/bi/dataservice
