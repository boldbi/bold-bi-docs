# Install Optional Libraries

## Client libraries

> **IMPORTANT:** Bold BI Enterprise Edition utilizes client libraries such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, and MongoDB to establish connections with their respective SQL database variants. To install the client libraries, you must read and accept the license agreement for each library.

1. Go to the client library location:
    ```cmd
    cd /var/www/bold-services/clientlibrary/
    ```

2. Under this location, you will find a consent document named <b>consent-to-deploy-client-libraries.txt</b>. Read the <b>LICENSE</b> details of the client libraries and proceed to the following steps to install them.
    ```cmd
    $sudo bash install-optional.libs.sh install-optional-libs npgsql,mongodb,influxdb,snowflake,mysql,oracle
    ```

 > **NOTE:** NOTE: If you encounter any issues with the designer, please execute the following command: </br>
  ```cmd
  sudo chown -R <current user name> /var/www/bold-services/application/bi/dataservice
  ```
