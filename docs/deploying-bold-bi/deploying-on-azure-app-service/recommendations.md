# Recommended Azure App service configuration to use Bold BI on Microsoft Azure App service

This section will explain the recommended Azure App service configuration for installing the Bold BI application. For a complete list of Azure App service plans, refer to the [Windows Azure App service plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/app-service/windows).

To have a better experience with Bold BI, you need to choose the correct Azure App service configuration.

## Azure App service plans for test, development, and production environments

For test and development environments, the Basic service plan can be used. You can also use the same basic service plan for the production environment if your app receives low or medium-level traffic.

## Recommended specifications for test and development environments

<table>
 <tr>
    <td>
       <span style="font-weight:bold">Component</span>
    </td>
     <td>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Azure App Service</span>
    </td>

 <tr>
 <td> Storage </td>
 <td> 10 GB or larger volume for Bold BI server storage </td>
 </tr>
 </table>

 > **NOTE:**  You can also use the above-recommended configuration Azure App service plan for low traffic production servers.

For high traffic and large data processing production environments, the Premium service plan is recommended. For more information about the Premium service plan, refer to the [App service plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/app-service/windows/).
