# Localization

This section explains how to generate localization files for your preferred language and apply them in either version [5.1.55 or later](/localization/latest/) or later, or version [4.2.69 or earlier](/localization/v4.2.69-or-earlier/) or earlier, of the Bold BI application deployed on your server.

> **NOTE:** The localization feature is not available in Syncfusion Managed Cloud Server, but it is available in On-Premises Deployment.
