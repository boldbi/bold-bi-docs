# Localization

This section explains how to generate localization files for your preferred language and apply them in either [5.1.55 or later](/localization/latest/) version (or) [4.2.69 or earlier](/localization/v4.2.69-or-earlier/) version of the Bold BI application deployed on your server.

> **NOTE:** The localization feature is not available in Cloud Analytics Server and it is available in Bold BI Embedded Analytics.
