# Responsive behavior in Bold BI

Generally, a responsive design on a website allows users to have a great experience regardless of the size of the device used to view the site.

Our `Bold BI` site also supports responsiveness for different layouts on various devices.

Bold BI allows you to view the dashboard in three kinds of layouts,

* Desktop
* Mobile
* Tablet

You can see the responsive visualizations of the Bold BI Dashboard [here](/responsive-layout/responsive-design-bold-bi-dashboard/).

Additionally, you can see the responsive visualizations of the Bold BI Server [here](/responsive-layout/responsive-design-bold-bi-server/).
