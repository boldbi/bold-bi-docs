# Responsive Design in Bold BI Dashboard
We can view the dashboards in desktop, mobile and tablet devices. The dashboard can be recomputed and adapt its view for different screen sizes and orientations. 

## Desktop Layout in Bold BI Dashboard
In Desktop layout, you can view the dashboard and perform various operations like Editing, Filtering, Views, Theme, Exporting, Comments and Sharing dashboards.
