# Responsive Design in Bold BI Dashboard
We can view the dashboards on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. The dashboard can be recomputed and adapt its view for different screen sizes and orientations.

## Desktop Layout in Bold BI Dashboard
In the Desktop layout, you can view the dashboard and perform various operations like editing, filtering, views, theme, exporting, comments, and sharing dashboards.

In this mode, you can view the dashboard in `Full Screen` by clicking the Full screen option in the top right corner of the dashboard.

Devices with a resolution higher than `1024 * 768` will be considered a desktop device, and the dashboards will be rendered based on it.

## Mobile Layout in Bold BI Dashboard
In the Mobile layout, you can view the dashboard with respect to different screen sizes for various mobile devices. The designed widgets in a dashboard will be arranged in a stack manner in both portrait and landscape orientations.

In mobile view, operations like full screen, editing, sharing dashboards, and tooltip for widgets will be disabled.

The default screen size for the mobile layout is `360 * 640` pixels.

The overflowed content in the `Title` of the dashboard will be hidden and shown with an `ellipsis (...)`.

The sample view of the dashboard in `Portrait` orientation for a mobile layout is shown below.
