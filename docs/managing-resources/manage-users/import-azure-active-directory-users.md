# Azure Active Directory User Import

This section explains how to search and import users from Azure Active Directory into the Bold BI.

> **NOTE:**  Azure Active Directory connection has to be configured in the [Azure Active Directory Settings](/site-administration/user-directory-settings/azure-active-directory/) in the `General` page for importing users.

Users belonging to the `System Administrator` group only can import Azure Active Directory users into the Bold BI.

## Search Users

Initially, any Active Directory users cannot be displayed until searching for the user.

You can search the Azure Active Directory users with any one of the below properties and choose them to import into the Bold BI. 

* Username
* Email Address
* Full name

A maximum of 1000 users will be searched and pulled from Azure Active Directory in a single request. 

Bold BI will list the search results of the users in the grid as shown in the below figure.

> **NOTE:**  The search result will be based on "starts with" query.

To import the Azure Active Directory users into the Bold BI, you have to choose the users from the list and click the `Import Selected Users` button at the top to import specific users or you can import all the users by clicking on the `Import All Users` button.
