# Azure Active Directory User Import

This section explains how to search for and import users from Azure Active Directory into Bold BI.

> **NOTE:**  Azure Active Directory connection has to be configured in the [Azure Active Directory Settings](/site-administration/user-directory-settings/azure-active-directory/) in the `General` page for importing users.

Only users belonging to the `System Administrator` group can import Azure Active Directory users into Bold BI.

## Search Users

Initially, Active Directory users will not be displayed until a search is conducted.

You can search for Azure Active Directory users using any of the following properties and choose to import them into Bold BI:

* Username
* Email Address
* Full name

A maximum of 1000 users will be searched and pulled from Azure Active Directory in a single request. 

Bold BI will display the search results of the users in a grid, as shown in the figure below.

> **NOTE:**  The search results will be based on a `starts with` query.

## Import Users

To import Azure Active Directory users into Bold BI, you must select the users from the list and click the `Import Selected Users` button at the top to import specific users. Alternatively, you can import all users by clicking on the `Import All Users` button.

Bold BI will import the selected users in the background as a job, and a confirmation dialog will be displayed as shown in the following figure.

You can check the status of the current import by clicking on the `View Status` button in the confirmation dialog above. This will take you to the bulk import job details page where you can see the specifics of the current import job.
