# Version History

Versions and file logs for each Dashboard will be maintained on the Dashboard server for every change in the Dashboard.

### Versions
For each change in the `.sydx` file, a new version will be created. All versions can be opened individually. The Dashboard can be rolled back to an older version at any time.

#### Version Comments
When creating or updating dashboards, users have the option to add comments. These comments serve as a useful reference and are displayed in the comments column for each version of the dashboard. To learn how to add comments to a dashboard, please refer [here](/getting-started/creating-dashboard/#publishing-dashboards-with-comments).

### File logs
For each change in the Dashboard, file logs will be added, including changes to the name, description, making public, making private, and security.
