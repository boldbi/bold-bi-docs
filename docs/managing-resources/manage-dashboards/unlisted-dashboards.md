# Unlisted Dashboards

Unlisted dashboards will not be listed to any users other than the owner, but users with the dashboard link can access the dashboards directly with their permission.

This section explains how to unlist the dashboard from listing.

### Steps to unlist a dashboard

1. Click the `Share Permissions` option in the Dashboards grid context menu.
