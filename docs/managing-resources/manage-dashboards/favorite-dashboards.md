# Favorite Dashboard

This section explains how to mark dashboards as favorites, remove a particular dashboard from favorites, and view the list of favorite dashboards in Bold BI.

## Mark a Dashboard as favorite

Dashboards can be marked as favorites to view them in the `Favorite Dashboards` category instead of searching for them in the categories or using keywords in the Dashboards list.

To mark a Dashboard as a favorite, click on the star icon near the Dashboard name. 
When clicked, the star icon is filled with color to indicate that it has been added as a favorite Dashboard.

## Remove a Dashboard from favorites

To remove a dashboard from favorites, click on the star icon next to the Dashboard name. 
Upon clicking, the star icon color will be emptied to indicate that it has been removed from favorites.
