> **NOTE:**  Before you import an OAuth group, first you need to configure the `Group Import settings` in authentication settings page. Refer this link [how to configure OAuth Authorization Settings](/security-configuration/single-sign-on/oauth-2.0-support/).This feature is available in Bold BI Embedded Analytics but not in Cloud Analytics Server.

## Import groups

To import the OAuth 2.0 groups, you can use both Dashboard Server and User Management Servers authentication provider. Choose the provider from the drop-down list at the top left corner.

Bold BI will import the chosen groups and a confirmation message will be displayed as shown in the following figure.

The success message box explains the groups status, which were imported into the Bold BI. Once you click `OK` or `Close Icon`, list will be reloaded and imported groups will disappear.

## To update authentication settings

If you want to update the OAuth settings, select the `Provider` from drop-down list and click the `Modify`. It will redirect to respective authentication settings page.
