# Import Group for OpenID Connect

This section explains how to import a single group or bulk groups from an OpenID provider and update the authentication settings of OpenID Connect in Bold BI.

Select the `Import from OpenID` option from the `New Group` drop-down list on the Groups homepage.

> **NOTE:**  Before importing an OpenID group, you need to configure the Group Import settings in the authentication settings page. Refer to this link on [how to configure OpenID Authorization Settings](/security-configuration/single-sign-on/openid-support/). This feature is available in On-Premises Deployment but not in Syncfusion Managed Cloud Server.

## Import groups

To import the OpenID Connect groups, you can use both the Dashboard Server and User Management Servers authentication provider. Choose the provider from the drop-down list at the top left corner.

Choose the groups from the list and click `Import groups` at the top right corner.

Bold BI will import the chosen groups and a confirmation message will be displayed as shown in the following figure.

The success message box explains the group's status, which was imported into the Bold BI. Once you click `OK` or the `Close Icon`, the list will be reloaded and the imported groups will disappear.

## To update authentication settings

If you want to update the OpenID settings, select the `provider` from the drop-down list and click `Modify`. It will redirect to the respective authentication settings page.
