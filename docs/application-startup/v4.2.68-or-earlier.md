## Application Startup for Bold BI Enterprise

The application startup screen helps you configure storage options and set up the admin account.

Application startup holds the storage options configuration for below application,

2. Bold BI - Manages dashboards, data sources, schedules and the user permissions.

## Storage Options

* SQL Server, Azure SQL
* PostgreSQL, Azure-PostgreSQL
* MySQL (Not applicable for Data Store Configuration) 
* Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility [(Please click here to know how to configure AWS Aurora)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.CreateInstance.html)

> **NOTE:** To connect with a PostgreSQL database, you need to install the PostgreSQL client library while installing the Bold BI Enterprise edition. Learn more [here](/deploying-bold-bi/deploying-on-windows/installation-and-deployment/#client-libraries).

## Database Configuration for Bold ID

This configuration stores the user identities and site details in the database. You can use any one of the following databases to configure the Bold ID.

[Click here to see the available storage options](#storage-options)

You can connect to the existing server instance using the options below.

## Storage Configuration for Bold ID

The user can select the preferred storage type, either File Storage or Blob Storage, to store the resource in Bold ID.

A new user should be created in order to access the Bold BI Sites and Dashboards, using the details mentioned in the image below.  

![Admin User Registration](/static/assets/application-startup/images/application-startup-admin-old.png)

While creating this new user account, a new group called `System Administrator` is also created.

By default, the `System Administrator` group has permission to do the following: 

* [Create Dashboards](/managing-resources/manage-dashboards/open-dashboards/)
* [Create Data Sources](/managing-resources/manage-data-sources/)
* [Create Schedules](/managing-resources/manage-schedules/)

By default, the newly created user account is assigned to this group.

## Storage Configuration for Bold BI

### File Storage

The default system is File Storage. In this system, the Dashboard Server stores the dashboards and data sources that are uploaded to the server in the following location on the installed machine. 

![Site File Storage](/static/assets/application-startup/images/file-storage-server.png)  

### Blob Storage

If the Dashboard Server wants to store the dashboards and data sources that are uploaded to the server in the blob storage location, it needs to provide the details shown in the figure below.

![Site Blob Storage](/static/assets/application-startup/images/blob-storage-server.png)  

You can find the details on how to configure the [Azure Blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal).

## Database Configuration for Data Store

The `DataStore` is essentially an intermediate database. It is used to store imported data from web data sources and statistic files. Additionally, you have the ability to update the data by utilizing the scheduled refresh option.

This configuration stores the data offline and helps to access the dashboards quickly. 

You can configure the database connection for data storage and then proceed with the next step.

![SQL Server DataStore](/static/assets/application-startup/images/application-startup-datastore.png)

You can use any one of the following databases to configure the Data Store.

[Click here to see the available storage options](#storage-options)

You can connect to the existing server instance using the options below.

* Create new database. 
* Use an existing database.

> **NOTE:** The credentials provided for connecting to the server instance must have the permissions specified in [this documentation](/faq/what-are-the-database-permissions-required-to-set-up-bold-bi-embedded/).

> **IMPORTANT:**  The Bold BI server will accept all connections that use Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.1/1.2) encryption and AES Cryptography (128 bits). When configuring the Data store, select the `Enable SSL` option to support encrypted data transfer.

After proceeding with Next, the application will register and validate the site information. Once the process is completed, you will be able to:
* Manage sites â€“ where you can manage permissions for the sites you have created 
* Go to Dashboards - where you can create, edit, update the dashboards and so on.
