# Resource Migration

Resource migration is the process of moving resources from one server to another. In Bold BI, you can migrate dashboards and data sources online, as well as dashboards offline.

## Online Migration

Online migration refers to the process of migrating dashboards and data sources from one Bold BI site to another Bold BI site over the internet or network. This migration process involves publishing the dashboards and data sources from the source site to the destination site. Online migration requires both the source and destination Bold BI sites to be online and accessible.

## Offline Migration

Offline migration refers to the process of migrating dashboards from one Bold BI site to another Bold BI site without using an internet or network connection. This migration process involves downloading the dashboard as a physical file from the source site and then uploading it to the destination site. Offline migration does not require both the source and destination Bold BI sites to be online at the same time.
