# Embedded Analytics

Embedded Analytics in Bold BI enables organizations to integrate dashboards directly into their applications, SaaS platforms, or web portals. This provides users with in-context insights, enhancing decision-making without switching between multiple tools.

> **Note:** Refer to the [Embedding Options](/embedding-options/#embedding-options) section for detailed explanation on the different embedding options available in the Bold BI dashboard.

## When to Choose Embedded Analytics?

Choose Embedded Analytics if:

- You need to integrate analytics into an application to provide in-app insights.

- Your business offers a customer-facing portal that requires interactive dashboards.

- Your users need role-based, personalized dashboards within an existing platform.

- You want a white-label solution to match your brandâ€™s look and feel.

- Your organization requires a scalable, secure, and API-driven analytics solution.

## Choosing the Right Embedding Option

Bold BI offers two primary embedding methods: [**iFrame Embedding**](https://help.boldbi.com/embedding-options/iframe-embedding/) and [**Embedding SDK**](https://help.boldbi.com/embedding-options/embedding-sdk/). Selecting the right approach depends on your business requirements, level of customization, and security needs.

### iFrame Embedding
Quickly embed interactive dashboards into your web pages with minimal setup and configuration using [iFrame Embedding](/embedding-options/iframe-embedding/). Ideal for fast deployment without extensive coding efforts.

### JavaScript SDK
Leverage our powerful [JavaScript SDK](https://help.boldbi.com/embedding-options/embedding-sdk/) to deeply integrate dashboards within your web applications. Gain full control over the embedded analytics experience, supporting frameworks like [Angular](/embedding-options/embedding-sdk/samples/angular-with-core/), [React](/embedding-options/embedding-sdk/samples/react-with-node-js/), [Vue.js](/embedding-options/embedding-sdk/samples/vuejs-with-go/), and more.
