# Overview of Bold BI

Bold BI is a complete embedded analytics platform that aims to bring the power of analytics to the end users for different use cases as part of their business applications. With its modern data architecture model and associated in-built capabilities, you can empower your users in making data-driven decisions more effectively. 

With Bold BI, you can connect to your data, transform it to your needs, create dashboard with related KPIs, and share it with your users for collaboration. In between these processes, there are several other capabilities that can be enabled based on your use case requirement.  

Bold BI comes with various deployment options. You can use the Syncfusion Cloud Managed service or deploy Bold BI in your cloud environment or on-premise servers.

Embedding is supported with any of these deployment options. Two different embedding methods are supported: JavaScript Embedding and IFrame Embedding. However, JavaScript Embedding is the recommended one due to its benefit of seamless website integration experience through our Embedded SDK APIs.
