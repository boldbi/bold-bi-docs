# User Directory Settings

This section explains how to configure Active Directory and Azure Active Directory with the Bold BI server and how to schedule the synchronization of users and groups from Active Directory and Azure Active Directory.

You can explore the user directory settings in detail here:

[Azure Active Directory](/site-administration/user-directory-settings/azure-active-directory/)

[Existing Database](/site-administration/user-directory-settings/existing-database/)

> **NOTE:** The Active Directory settings are available in the On-Premises Deployment but not in Syncfusion Managed Cloud Server.
