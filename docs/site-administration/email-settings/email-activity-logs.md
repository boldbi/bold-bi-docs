# Email Activity Logs

The email activity logs allow us to track whether the email was sent to the recipients or not. Logs contain information about each email, including the **sender and recipient, date and time, status, and any associated error messages**.

You can see the details of the email activity logs by clicking the `Logs` tab on the Email Settings page.

> **NOTE:**  This email activity logs only show the status of whether the email was sent from the Bold BI server to your SMTP configured server or not. If an email is sent from the Bold BI to your SMTP server, but the SMTP server is unable to deliver the email to the recipient, then the logs will not be shown here. This settings option is available in Bold BI Embedded Analytics but not in Cloud Analytics Server.
