# Email Settings

The email settings page is divided into two sections: `Settings`, where you can configure your SMTP settings, and `Logs`, where you can track the status of your email delivery from the Bold BI application.

[Configuration](/site-administration/email-settings/configuration/)

[Email Activity Logs](/site-administration/email-settings/email-activity-logs/)
