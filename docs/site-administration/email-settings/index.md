# Email Settings

The email settings page is divided into two sections: `Settings,` where you can configure your SMTP settings, and `Logs,` where you can track the status of your email delivery from the Bold BI application.

[Email Settings Configuration](/site-administration/email-settings/email-settings-configuration/)

[Email Activity Logs](/site-administration/email-settings/email-activity-logs/)

> **NOTE:** This settings option is available in Bold BI Embedded Analytics but not in Cloud Analytics Server.
