# Email Account Settings

This section explains how to configure the email settings in the Bold BI Server to send emails using either SMTP or Microsoft Office 365 accounts, including OAuth authentication for the latter.
* [SMTP Account](/site-administration/email-settings/configuration/smtp-account/)

* [Microsoft Office 365 Account with OAuth authentication](/site-administration/email-settings/configuration/office-365-account/)
