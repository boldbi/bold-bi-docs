> **NOTE:** The updated card information will apply from the next billing cycle of the Bold BI Cloud subscription.

## Retry Payment on failure

If the payment for the current billing cycle fails, the pending payment for the subscription can be paid by retrying payment at any time through the `Payments` tab in the settings page. 
If the payment fails due to card issues, the pending payment can also be paid by updating the card through the `Update and pay now` option.
