# Webhook Failure Handling

## Webhook retry

The webhook is sent up to five times by the retry mechanism before failing with exponential backoff.

## Automatic Webhook Deactivation

If a webhook fails 20 times in a row, it updates the failure log and deactivates the webhook.

## Webhook Failure Logs

Webhook failure logs contain details about failed webhook attempts. If a webhook fails, you can examine the failure logs by clicking the `Failure Logs` tab on the Integration Settings page.
