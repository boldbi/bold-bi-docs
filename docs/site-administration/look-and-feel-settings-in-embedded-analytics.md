# Look and Feel Settings in Bold BI Embedded Analytics

This page explains how to customize font and theme preferences for your site in Bold BI.

## Inherit from Global Settings

By default, the `Inherit from Global Settings` option is enabled, and the `Look and Feel` settings will be inherited from **UMS site settings**.

The font and theme preferences will be applied as same as in **UMS site settings**.
