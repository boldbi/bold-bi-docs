# Enable lock synchronization for the dashboard and datasources

This section explains enabling or disabling the synchronization of dashboards and data sources from external sites. Utilizing this feature in the dashboard settings allows you to permit or prevent any changes or updates to the dashboards and data sources from these external sites.

## Enable or Disable lock synchronization

By default, the `Lock Resource Synchronization` option is disabled on the dashboard settings page.
