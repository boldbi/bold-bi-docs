# Mark Dashboards as Public - Allow/Restrict Switch

This section explains how to allow/restrict marking the Dashboards as public from the administration dashboards settings page.

You can control the ability for users to make the Dashboards public through the `Dashboards` settings tab on the settings page. Users can mark the Dashboards as public if the administrator allows the option to `Mark dashboards as public`.

## Take control over the public Dashboards

If the administrator has allowed it, users can mark the Dashboards as public and other users will be able to see them. 
If the administrator has restricted this option, the public Dashboards cannot be viewed by users unless they have permission.
