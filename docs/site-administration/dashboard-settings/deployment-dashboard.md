# Deployment dashboards
You can publish one or more dashboards to a site while creating that site by setting the deployment dashboards.

> **NOTE:** This feature is available in On-Premises Deployment but not in Syncfusion Managed Cloud Server.

This section explains how to add dashboards to each site while deploying that site in the Bold BI application.

## Add deployment dashboards
To add deployment dashboards, follow these steps:

1. Click the `gear` icon and go to the dashboard setting page, as shown in the following image.

6. You can publish a dashboard with public accessibility by checking the Make Dashboard Public option. This allows anonymous users who have access to the Dashboard link to access it.
