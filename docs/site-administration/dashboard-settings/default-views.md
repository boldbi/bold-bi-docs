# Default views for the dashboard

The dashboard can have multiple views, and if a specific view needs to be rendered by default, it can be achieved using the default views option.

## Steps to set the default view for the dashboard

The dashboard view can be set as the default view in two ways:

1. [While saving the view](/managing-resources/manage-dashboards/manage-dashboard-views/#steps-to-add-a-dashboard-view).
2. [From the views list of the dashboard](/managing-resources/manage-dashboards/manage-dashboard-views/#set-a-default-view-for-the-dashboard).

The following section explains how default views are managed by the administrator and how to remove default views for the dashboard in Bold BI.

## Administrator control over default view

If the administrator has enabled `Default views` in the Dashboard Settings page, then the user can set the default views for the dashboard either while saving the dashboard views or from the dashboard views listing panel.
