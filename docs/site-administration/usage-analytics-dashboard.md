# Usage Analytics Dashboard

The usage analytics dashboard is predefined and enables you to monitor dashboard activity to better understand how users are interacting with dashboards.

The usage analytics dashboards are listed in the `Usage Analytics` category on the dashboard listing page.

You can show or hide the usage analytics category in the dashboard listing page based on [Usage analytics](/embedded-bi/site-administration/dashboard-settings/usage-analytics) option in the dashboard settings page.

> **NOTE:**  The `Usage Analytics` option is available only to admin users, and usage analytics dashboards are read-only.
