# Two Factor Authentication
The two-factor authentication support for logging in has been provided. This enables an extra layer of security for your Bold BI account. This support provides stronger protection against unauthorized access to user accounts. Once enabled for each login, this option will prompt you to enter a verification code that is generated by your smartphone.

To enable or disable the Two-Factor Authentication for the user account, please refer to this [link](/embedded-bi/profile/#two-factor-authentication)

If you have 2FA enabled, the Bold BI login page will prompt for the verification code. Enter the verification code from any TOTP (Time-based One-time Password) application or recovery code to verify your identity. Using the `Don't ask again on this device` check box, skip the 2FA verification on your subsequent login.
