# Two Factor Authentication
Two-factor authentication support has been provided for logging into your Bold BI account. This extra layer of security helps protect against unauthorized access to user accounts. When enabled, this option will require you to enter a verification code generated by your smartphone each time you log in.

To enable or disable Two-Factor Authentication for your user account, please refer to this [link](/managing-resources/manage-users/profile/#two-factor-authentication)

If Two-Factor Authentication is enabled, the Bold BI login page will prompt you for a verification code. Enter the code from a TOTP (Time-based One-time Password) application or a recovery code to verify your identity. You can choose to skip the 2FA verification on subsequent logins by checking the `Don't ask again on this device` box.
