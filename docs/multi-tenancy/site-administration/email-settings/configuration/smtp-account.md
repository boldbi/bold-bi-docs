# SMTP Account in User Management Server

This section explains how to configure the [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) details in the User Management Server to send emails.

**The User Management Server requires the following SMTP details in order to send emails.**

<table>
<tr>
    <td>SMTP Server</td>
    <td>The SMTP server specifies the public IP address or provider which delivers the emails to the end user mail box.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>SMTP Port</td>
    <td>The port number of the SMTP server may vary depending on the SMTP server and the connection type (SSL/TLS).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Sender Name</td>
    <td>The name displayed on the email as the "From" name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Sender Email Address</td>
    <td>The email address, which is displayed as the "From" email address in the recipient's email.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Authentication type</td>
<td>
We support two types of authentications:

1. Basic Authentication: This is the default authentication type that requires a username and password.
2. Anonymous authentication: You can choose this option if you have disabled authentication on your SMTP server.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Username</td>
    <td>The username of the sender's email account with send mail access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Password</td>
    <td>The password of the sender's email account.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Enable SSL</td>
    <td>If SSL is enabled, it will be used to connect with your SMTP server. Otherwise, the connection will be made using TLS.</td>
</tr>
</table>
