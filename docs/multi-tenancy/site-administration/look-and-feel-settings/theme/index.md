# Theme

You can switch the application's theme from light to dark mode and vice versa using this option. Additionally, you can customize the **text color**, **active state**, and **hover state background color**. You can also customize components such as **switches**, **radio buttons**, **check boxes**, and **numeric text boxes** by using **branding colors**. The **dashboard theme** can also be customized in this option.
   
## Switch Application Theme Mode

The application theme mode can be switched to either **light** or **dark mode**. By default, the light mode is applied.

In the default light mode, the application will have a light appearance with the blue variant as the branding color, as shown in the image below.

In dark default mode, the application will have a dark appearance with a blue variant as the branding color, as shown in the image below.

## Custom Theme

You can upload a customized theme file using the `Manage` option in the theme section. With this feature, you can change the **branding color**, **text color**, **active state**, and **hover state background colors**, in addition to choosing between light or dark mode. The background and surface areas cannot be customized and will always follow the selected mode.

Please follow the steps below to create and apply a custom theme for the application:
1. Click on the `Manage` option to open a dialog for uploading your custom theme.
