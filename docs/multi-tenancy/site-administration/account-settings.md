# Accounts configuration in User Management Server

This section explains the configuration to activate user accounts and user email in the User Management Server.

## Account activation modes

There are two account activation modes available:

### Automatic activation

When user activation is set to `Automatic Activation` mode, user accounts will be activated automatically while adding users in the User Management Server.

### Email activation

When user activation is set to `Email Activation` mode, user accounts are not activated while adding users in User Management Server, and an account activation email with an activation link is sent to the email address to activate the user account.

The account will be in inactive status until the user activates the account from the activation email.

> **NOTE:** By default, the setting will be `Automatic`.

### Email not required
