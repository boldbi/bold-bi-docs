# Configuring and Formatting Grid

`Grid` allows you to showcase the ranking relationship by the vertical arrangement of items ordered from top to bottom.

## How to configure the table data to Grid

> **NOTE:**  Before adding the Grid widget to the design layout, make sure to **create the data source**. You can refer to this [section](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/creating-a-new-data-source/) to learn how to create a new data source.

To construct a grid, a minimum requirement of one column is needed. You can visualize both measure, calculated measure, and dimension column data in the grid control. You can also add a column that is hidden from the view by adding the column to the hidden columns section. The data of these columns will be hidden from the view but can be used for filtering other widgets in the dashboard.

The following steps explains data configuration of grid:

### Step 1: Creating a grid widget

1. Drag and drop the Grid control icon from the toolbox into the design panel. You can find control by searching in the toolbox.

![Adding grid](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/adding-grid.png)

2. Resize the widget as required. 

![Resizing widget](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/resizing.png)

### Step 2: Configuring data into the widget

1. Click the `Properties` icon in the configuration panel.

![Properties icon](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/designerpropertiesbutton.png)

2. The `properties` panel of the widget will be displayed as shown in the following screenshot. Now, switch to the `ASSIGN DATA` tab.

![Assign data click](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/assign-data-click.png)

3. The `ASSIGN DATA` tab will be opened with available columns from the connected data source.

![Data pane](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/data-pane.png)

#### Column section

Bind column by dragging and dropping element from `Measures` or `Dimension` section to `Columns` section.

![After adding column](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/configured-widgets.png)

> **NOTE:**  * 1000 records are displayed by default for the optimized Grid rendering performance (100 records in mobile view) and then additional rows will be scrolled virtually on-demand.

> **NOTE:**  * If any of the Grid columns have conditional formatting, bar template, or KPI applied only 100 records will be fetched by default and then scrolled on-demand.

#### Hidden column section

You can drag and drop the elements to `Hidden Columns` if required. Based on the hidden column elements, the values will be shown in grid widget.

![Hidden column configuration](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/hidden-column.png)

## How to format grid widget

You can format the grid for better illustration of the view that you require using the settings available in `Properties` tab.

### General settings

![General settings](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/general-settings.png)

#### Name 

This allows you to set `title` for this grid widget.

#### Subtitle

This allow you to set `subtitle` for this grid widget.

#### Description

This allows you to set a brief explanation about this grid widget.

### Basic settings

![Basic settings](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/grid-basicsetting.png)

#### Allow sorting

You can toggle the interactive sorting of columns in grid control using this option. `It is enabled by default.`

#### Fit to content

The columns in the grid can be made to auto size based on the length of the content of the column. `This option is not enabled by default`.

#### Allow Text Wrap

This allows you to wrapping whole the text if text length is high.

#### Horizontal grid lines

You can enable or disable horizontal grid lines in the grid control. `This option is enabled by default.`

#### Vertical grid lines

You can enable or disable vertical lines in the grid control. `This option is enabled by default.`

#### Show Border

This allows you to enable or disable the border of the grid control. This option is enabled by default.

#### Enable Alternative Row

This allows you to differentiate alternative rows of the grid by the background color. If you enable this property, alternative rows change their background color as `#F7F7F7` by default, it can be customized from the `Content Settings` section.

![Grid Row Height](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/grid-alternativerowcolor.png)

#### Page settings

In the Grid widget, we used to display 100 records on the initial grid rendering and load another set of records on scrolling for better performance. Now, with the help of Page settings, you can customize the number of records to be fetched on initial rendering and perform scrolling based on the Page Size count.

![Page Settings](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/pagesettings.png)

#### Page Size

By default, the Page Size value will be set as 100. You can customize the page size value based on requirements. For example, the data configured to the Grid has 2000 records and we set the page size as 50. On initial rendering, the grid loaded with 50 records then on scrolling, and another 50 records will be fetched and loaded into the grid.

![Page Settings](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/page.png)

**Page size for first 15 records**

![Page Settings](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/pagesizerec.png)

**Fetching of another 15 records**

![Page Settings](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/grid/pagesettings-customize.png)

#### Allow Paging

On enabling paging, the Grid will be displayed in the paged view. The number of pages and the Number of data to be displayed on a single page is determined by the `Page size count` and `Total record count.` For example, if we set the page size as 100 and the grid has 2000 records then on initial rendering, the grid loaded with 100 records on its first page and the Total number of pages will be 20. On navigating to the next page, the other 100 records will be fetched and displayed on the next page. If we navigate to some random page, say the 10th page for example then we fetch the data corresponding to the 10th page based on the index.

**Allow Paging**
