# Configuring Pivot Grid

Pivot grid allows you to display summarized data in cross tabular format i.e., in rows and columns.

![pivot-grid](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-grid-demo.png)

## How to configure table data to pivot grid?

> **NOTE:** Before adding the Pivot grid widget to the design layout, make sure to create the data source. You can refer to [this section](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/creating-a-new-data-source/) to learn how to create a new data source. 

Pivot grid need a minimum of 1 value , 1 row and 1 column element to showcase proper pivot table details. The measure or expression field that you would like to analyze can be dropped into `Value(s)` field. The dimension that you would like to categorize the measure based on row and column can be dropped in `Row(s)` and `Column(s)` field.

The following steps explain how to configure the data to a Pivot grid:

1.  Drag and drop the pivot grid widget into a canvas and resize it to your required size.

![pivot-grid_dragDrop](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/drop-widget.png)

2.  To open the Property pane, click the `Properties` icon in the Configuration panel.

![configurationPanel_propertyIcon](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/designerpropertiesbutton.png)

3.  In the property pane, switch to the `ASSIGN DATA` tab from the `PROPERTIES,` to assign data to the pivot grid data fields.

![pivot-grid_properties](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/properties.png)

4.  The `ASSIGN DATA` tab will be opened with available measures and dimensions from the connected data source. Also it contains `Value(s),` `Row(s),` and `Column(s)` field as mentioned earlier.

![pivot-grid_assignData](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/assign-data.png)

#### Adding data to Value(s) field

You can add more than one `Measures` into `Value(s)` field by drag and drop the required measure.

![pivot-grid_bindValue](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/bindValue.png)


Now the pivot grid will be rendered like this for single data

![pivot-grid_valueRender](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-value-render.png)

Pivot grid will be rendered like this, if more than one data bind to `Value(s)`

![pivot-grid_valueMultiRender](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-gridmultirender.png)

If more than one data is added to `Value(s)` field and then grid column is separated based on the number of data attached to `Value(s)` field, as shown in above image.

Click the `Settings` option to change the name by using the `Rename` option and the required summary type from the available summary types shown in `Settings.`

![pivot-grid_valueSettingIcon](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/settings-value.png)

#### Filtering data 

You can filter the data to be displayed in pivot grid by using filter. For more details, refer [filter](/cloud-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/configuring-widget-filters/).

![pivot-grid_valueSettingFilter](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-gridfilter.png)

#### Formatting data

You can format the data to be displayed in the pivot grid by using format option. For more details, refer [measure format](/cloud-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/formatting-measure-type-column/)

![pivot-grid_valueSettingFormat](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-gridformat.png)


You can add more than one column from `Dimensions` field into `Value(s)` field.

### Adding Column(s)

Adding single data to `Value(s)` and `Column(s)`

![pivot-gridsingleValuesColumn](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-gridsinglevaluecolumn.png)

![pivot-grid-singleValuesColumn](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-gridsinglevaluecolumn-change.png)

You can change the `Settings`.

![Settings](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/settings.png)

#### Sorting data

You can `Sort` the dimension data using `Sort` option under `Settings` menu list. To apply sorting for the data, refer [Sort](/cloud-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/advanced-sorting/#dimension-column).

![Sort Settings](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/sortdimension.png)

#### Filtering data

You can apply filters by selecting filter in settings. For more details, refer [filter](/cloud-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/configuring-widget-filters/#configuring-filter-for-dimension-column).

![Configuring widget filters](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/configuring-widget-filters.png)


Similarly, you can add the `Measures` and `Expressions` into the `column(s)` field.

#### Adding Row(s)

You can drag and drop the `Measure` or `Dimension` into the `Row(s)` field. 

![pivot-grid_rowData](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/rowdata.png)

You can apply [filter](/cloud-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/configuring-widget-filters/#configuring-filter-for-dimension-column) and [sort](/cloud-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/advanced-sorting/#dimension-column) option for the rows field, if required.

#### Adding Multiple Column(s)

If more than one data is added to `Column(s)` field and then the arrow icon or node is prepended to each cell of the column header. A new tree view list will be opened when the arrow icon is clicked.

Adding Multiple data to `Column(s)` with single `Value(s)` and `Row(s)`

![pivot-grid_multipleColumn](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-gridmultiplecolumn.png)


#### Adding Multiple Row(s)

If more than one data is added to `Row(s)` field and then the arrow icon or node is prepended to each cell of the row header. A new tree view list will be opened when the arrow icon is clicked.

Adding Multiple data to `Row(s)` with single `Value(s)` and `Column(s)`

![pivot-grid_multipleRow](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-gridmultiplerow.png)

#### Hidden column section

You can drag and drop the elements to `Hidden Columns` if required. Based on the hidden column elements, the values will be shown.

### Removing Data from Field

To remove the added data from fields click the highlighted cross icon.

![pivot-grid_valueRemove](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-remove.png)

> **Important** 

### Data Limit

 * For now, the pivot grid has a limitation of data up to 10K records.

## How to format pivot grid?

Pivot grid can be formatted for better illustration of the view, through the settings available in Properties tab.

To format pivot grid follow the below steps

1.	Drag and drop the pivot grid into canvas and resize it to your required size.

2.	Click on Settings icon and Configure the data from `ASSIGN DATA` tab as mentioned in previous section, then switch back to `PROPERTIES` tab.


The property window will be opened.

![Property window](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/pivot-property-window.png)

You can see the list of properties available for the widget with default value.

#### Show No Data Item

`Show No Data Item` displays the empty data cell of selected `Name` from `Edit Field Settings`. For example, if the ShipCity's `Show No Data Item` is checked and then it displays all the empty data points as empty cell similar to the below image.

![pivot-grid_prop-edit-noDataItem](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/pivot-grid/nodata.png)

In the above image other than Campinas, all other cities have empty data and so it displayed as empty cells.

This allows you to define this pivot grid widget to ignore responding to the filter actions applied on other widgets in dashboard.

#### Hierarchical Filter

Through this option, you can enable/disable hierarchical top `N` filtering. While applying Top N filter with multiple dimension columns, the data returned can be customized based on whether the filtering need to be done as flat or based on the hierarchy of dimension columns added. 

When `Hierarchical Filter` option is enabled, the Top N will be applied for each individual column separately based on the number set for each column.

## How to apply conditional formatting in pivot grid

In case, if you have the requirement to highlight any data based on some conditions, you might be required to enable the advanced formatting option.
