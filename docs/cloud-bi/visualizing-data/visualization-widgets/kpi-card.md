## How to configure data into KPI card 

> **NOTE:** Before adding the card widget to the design layout, make sure to create the data source. You can refer to [this section](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/creating-a-new-data-source/) to learn how to create a new data source. 

> **IMPORTANT:** To showcase a KPI Card, a minimum requirement of both actual and target values is needed.

After creating a data source, follow the given steps to configure the data into the card widget:

1. Drag the `KPI Card` control icon from the tool box into the design panel. You can find the control in the tool box by search.

![Series view](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/configured-widget-series-view.png)

You can filter and sort the records using the settings menu items. 

![Settings options](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/settings-option.png)

**Sorting**: You can customize the `sorting` behavior of dimension fields in the KPI Card widget. You can also order them based on **alphabet** or **value**, **data source (default)**, or **field**. Refer to [here], for the detailed steps.(/cloud-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/advanced-sorting/) for the detailed steps. 

 Refer to this page to learn how to apply measure filter. 

**Filtering**: You can use the `Filter` option to `filter` the data by specifying the filter condition.

Refer to this [page](/cloud-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/configuring-widget-filters/#configuring-filter-for-dimension-column) to learn how to apply measure filter. 

### Sparkline

You can use the `Sparkline` section to showcase the variation of measurement in the KPI Card widget.

![Configure Sparkline](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/configure-sparkline.png)

![Card with Sparkline](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/card-with-sparkline.png)

### Image

The `image` section allows you to configure the image data for each KPI card or records. The image data may be the direct URL for the records or contains a part of the URL. 

#### Direct URL

In the following example, each country flag is displayed in the KPI card by configuring the **Country Image** field. The Country Image column from the data source contains the full URL of the country flag. 

Data screenshot 

![Example data](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/sample-widget.png)

Follow the given steps to show the country image in the KPI card series:

1. Configure the `Country Image` field into the `Image` section.

![Configure Image](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/configure-image.png)

2.	Make sure whether the `pattern` text is properly updated in the `Properties` pane image section.

![Pattern](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/image-pattern.png)

3.	Now, the widget will be rendered with image data.

![Widget with Image](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/widget-with-image.png)

#### Partial image data 

If your data source contains the partial data of the URL means you need to enter the URL text with the proper patterns. 

For an example, consider the following data source. 

![Example data](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/sample-for-partial-image.png)

It contains the Players name and part of their image URL in the above columns. 
The full image URL for `Cristiano Ronaldo` is `https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Cristiano_Ronaldo_2018.jpg/345px-Cristiano_Ronaldo_2018.jpg` and the Player Image Column contains the information is `commons/thumb/8/8c/Cristiano_Ronaldo_2018.jpg/345px-Cristiano_Ronaldo_2018.jpg`. So you need to enter the URL as `https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/{0}` Where the **{0}** indicates the first field in the Image

> **IMPORTANT:** 1)	You can add any number of fields in the image section and need to append {0}, {1} for the first , second fields configured in the image section.
> **IMPORTANT:** 2)	If more than one data is available for the record the first record with the highest measure will be used to display in the KPI Card widget. 

For example, if you try to show the goals of each team and configure the player image in the image section, it will show top scorer image off each team as shown in the following screenshot. 

*Configure Image section:*

![Configure Image](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/kpi-card/configure-image-field.png)

*Ensure pattern*
