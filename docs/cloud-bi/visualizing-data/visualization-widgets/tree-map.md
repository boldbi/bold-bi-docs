# Configuring and Formatting Tree Map

`Tree map` allows you to visualize large data using its proportional shelves and color scales.

## How to configure the table data to tree map widget

> **NOTE:**  Before adding the Treemap widget to the design layout, make sure to **create the data source**. You can refer to this [section](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/creating-a-new-data-source/) to learn how to create a new data source.

> **IMPORTANT:**  To showcase a tree map, a minimum requirement of one value and one group by field is needed.

The following steps explains data configuration of tree map.

### Step 1: Add a tree map widget to the design canvas 

1. Drag and drop the Tree Map control icon from the toolbox into the design panel. You can find the control in toolbox by search.

2.	Resize the widget as required.

![Repositioning treemap widget](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/tree-map/resizing-widget.png)

### Step 2: Configuring data into the widget

1.   Click the `Properties` icon in the `configuration panel.`

![Clikcing properties pane icon](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/designerpropertiesbutton.png)

2.	The `properties` panel of the widget will be displayed as shown in the following screenshot. Now, switch to the `ASSIGN DATA` tab.

![Properties pane view](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/tree-map/propertypanel.png)

3.	The data tab will be opened with the available columns from the connected data source.

![Assign data pane](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/tree-map/data-pane.png)

### Adding Value section 

Bind column by dragging and dropping element from sections to `values.`

![Adding value field](/static/assets/cloud/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/images/tree-map/addingvalues.png)

> **IMPORTANT:**  
* The field added in this section will act as a measure value. 
* It is a mandatory section and minimum of one value is needed for visualization. 
* Maximum of two fields can only be added. 

You can `filter,` `format,` and `Rename` the data displayed in the widget from the settings menu options.  To open the `settings menu,` click the `settings icon.`

The following screenshots shows the various settings menu options based on the type of field configured in the type of section.
