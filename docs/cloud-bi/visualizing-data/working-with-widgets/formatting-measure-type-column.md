# Formatting Measure Type Column

Measure type column values can be formatted based on the following different options:

**Type**

The value display type of measure column can be defined based on the displayed data. For example, if you display the sales amount column, then the type can be defined as `Currency`.

**Representation**

The value display format can be defined by the representation. For example, by selecting thousands, the value 10,000 will be displayed as 10K.
