# Collaboration in the Bold BI

This section explains how to collaborate with other users in the Bold BI cloud by commenting on dashboards.

The Collaboration feature in Bold BI lets users write comments on a dashboard to share with other users who have access to the dashboard. It is useful for tracking events and providing insights into those events. Users can also add links to other dashboards or any external websites. 

Anyone with access to a dashboard can write comments. When a comment is added to a dashboard, users who have notifications enabled in their profile receive email and system notifications. Learn more about the notifications in [this](/cloud-bi/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/notifications/) documentation.

## Post a new comment

To post a new comment, open the dashboard and click the **comment** icon in the top-right corner as shown in the following image.
