# Previewing Dashboard

  You can preview the currently opened dashboard by clicking the `Preview` at right corner in the tools pane.

  The preview button can be visible across all window tab views in the Dashboard Designer, and it allows you to preview the dashboard from anywhere within the application.
  
## Previewing dashboard using dashboard viewer

   The dashboard can be previewed using built-in dashboard viewer that is opened in the default web browser.

   The dashboard viewer can be split into two sections such as `Title` and `Content` as shown in the following screenshot.

   The `Title` section holds the dashboard title and description (viewed by clicking the `i` icon near to the title) that are set in the Dashboard Designer before publish.

   You can interact with dashboard widgets in the viewer and apply filter on top of other widgets based on the dashboard filters configuration made in the dashboard through Dashboard Designer.

   Each widget in the dashboard viewer is split into two sections such as `Title` and `Content`.
