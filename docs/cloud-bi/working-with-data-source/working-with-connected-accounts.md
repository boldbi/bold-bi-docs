## Reauthorize the connected accounts

You can reauthorize the account you connected earlier by clicking the reauthorize button in the context menu.

Re-authorize action is required if, both the refresh token (long live token) and access token expires for that account. On such cases users will have to re-enter the credentials to keep the data in sync. 

1. Click the `Reauthorize` option.
