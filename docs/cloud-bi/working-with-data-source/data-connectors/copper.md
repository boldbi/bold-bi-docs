## Create Copper data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Copper data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid Copper REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Copper API documentation](https://developer.copper.com/?version=latest) for more details.

    Example: [https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/leads/search](https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/leads/search)

3. Select **POST** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. Select either *Parameter(s)* or *Raw* under **Request Body**. Set *page_size* as key and set your page size value.
5. Set values for **Headers** section like below key-value pairs:

5. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
6. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
7. Choose **None** under **Authentication Type**.

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### How do I get API Key for connecting Copper data source?
1. Login to [Copper](https://www.copper.com/) account. Go to *Settings -> API Keys*.
2. Use this *API key* as value for **X-PW-AccessToken** in Copper data source in Bold BI Dashboard.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL

1. For instance, to get the specific task details, query the <i>/tasks/search</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed information get the ID of the specific task.

> **NOTE:**  To get the specific task detail, set the **Method Type** as *GET*. Set Method Type based on endpoint. 

Replace it in the URL to query a particular payment:

[https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/tasks/&lt;:task_id&gt;](https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/tasks/%3c:task_id%3e)

### Sample queries
**List Contact Types**

[https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/contact_types](https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/contact_types)

**List Lead Statuses**

[https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/lead_statuses](https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/lead_statuses)

### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.
