## Create App Annie data source
Once you click the App Annie data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create App Annie data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid App Annie REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [App Annie API documentation](https://support.appannie.com/hc/en-us) for more details.

    Example: [https://api.appannie.com/v1.3/accounts](https://api.appannie.com/v1.3/accounts)

3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with your dashboard.  
5. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
6. Replace **&lt;:your_api_token&gt;** under **Headers** with a valid bearer token.
7. Choose **None** under **Authentication Type** as authentication is done through header.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
