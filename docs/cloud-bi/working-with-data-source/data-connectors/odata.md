# Connecting Bold BI to OData data source
Bold BI dashboard designer supports connecting OData web services through REST API. 

## Choose OData data source
To configure the OData data source, follow the below steps:
1. Click the **Data Sources** button in the configuration panel to add a new data connection.

   ![Data source icon](/static/assets/cloud/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/common/DataSourcesIcon.png)

2. Click **CREATE NEW** to launch a new connection from the connection panel.
3. Select the **OData** connection in the connection panel.

> **NOTE:**  You can also create a data source from the home page by clicking the **Data Sources** menu from left menu panel and **Create Data Source** from the data sources page.

## Create OData data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create OData data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid OData REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [OData API documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) for more details.

    Example: [https://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/Orders](https://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/Orders)

3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the OData data source. This value is used to fetch the data from OData data source via pagination.
5. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
6. Choose the **Data Format** based on your OData service (JSON / XML). 
7. Choose one of the **Authentication Type** from the dropdown.
8. To connect based on the chosen Authentication, refer [Supported Authentication Types](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/odata/#authentication-for-odata).

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

## Fetching table with single entity and multiple entities

### To fetch single entity

To pull data from a particular table use the odata table endpoint directly.

Example, https://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/Customers 

Only the Customers table will be extracted into Bold BI.

### To fetch multiple entities

You can use the service root URL to extract multiple tables into Bold BI at once.

Example service root URL, https://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/

1. Choose the tables needed to be extracted into Bold BI and click Connect.

2. Once multiple tables are moved, you can perform join on the available tables, if required, to gain insights.

### Authentication for OData 

#### *None*
1. To connect to OData services without any authentication choose this type. You can also pass the API token in header if required.

#### *Basic http Authentication*
1. Enter a valid username and password of your OData service.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.
* The Choose Schema(s) dialog opens. The schema represents the key fields of JSON data retrieved from OData Rest API request. This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and its corresponding values in grid for preview. Select required schema(s) from treeview to use in designer and click **Connect**.

   ![Preview](/static/assets/cloud/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/common/Preview.png)

* Now, the data design view page with selected table schema opens. Drag and drop the table.
