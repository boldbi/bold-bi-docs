## Authentication with Podio
Use the following steps to authenticate with Podio web service:

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your Podio account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by Bold BI dashboards.  
> **NOTE:**  If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.
3. Set a name to identify the account and click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect via already connected account, refer to the [Connected Accounts](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/podio/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

     > **NOTE:**  To connect with a new account click **Connect New Account**.


## Connect to Podio
### Create Podio data source
After successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow these steps to create a Podio data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Click the **API Endpoints** down drop box and choose the required endpoint.
3. Click **Custom Url** to enter the URL manually. Refer the [Podio API documentation](https://developers.podio.com/doc) for more details.
4. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
5. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
6. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
7. The authentication type will be set to **Podio** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with Podio account.

You can also edit the connection information set using the [Edit Connection](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>

</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL
1. For instance, to query about the specific notification, query the <i>/notification</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed information, you can get the ID of the specific notification.

Replace it in the URL to query a particular notification:

`https://api.podio.com//notification/<:notification_id>`

### Sample queries
**Get Conversations**

https://api.podio.com/conversation

**Get Batches**

https://api.podio.com/batch

**Get files**

https://api.podio.com/file

### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.
* The Choose Schema(s) dialog opens. The schema represents the key fields of JSON data retrieved from the Podio Rest API request. This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and its corresponding values in the grid for preview. Select required schema(s) from treeview to use in designer and click **Connect**.
