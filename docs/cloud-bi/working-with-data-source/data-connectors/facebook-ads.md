2. Choose the radio button **Insights** or **Graph API** for selecting the required API Endpoints.
3. Click **Insights** radio button for choosing the **Pages** in your Facebook Ads account and the **Insights** API Endpoints.
4. Click **Graph API** radio button for choosing the **Pages** in your Facebook Ads account and the **Graph API** API Endpoints.
5. Enter a valid Facebook Ads REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Facebook Ads API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/) for more details.
6. Click **CUSTOMURL** to enter the URL manually.   
7. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
8. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.
