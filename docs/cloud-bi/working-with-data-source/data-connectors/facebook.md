## Authentication with Facebook
Use the following steps to authenticate with Facebook web service:

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your Facebook account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by Bold BI dashboards.

   > **NOTE:** If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.

3. Set a name to identify the account and click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect using existing connected account, refer [Connected Accounts](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/facebook/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

> **NOTE:** To connect to another account click **Connect New Account.**


## Connect to Facebook
### Create Facebook data source
After successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Facebook data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Choose the radio button **Insights** or **Graph API** for selecting the required API Endpoints.
3. Click **Insights** radio button for choosing the **Pages** in your Facebook account and the **Insights** API Endpoints.
4. Click **Graph API** radio button for choosing the **Pages** in your Facebook account and the **Graph API** API Endpoints.
5. Enter a valid Facebook REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Facebook API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/) for more details.
6. Click **CUSTOMURL** to enter the URL manually.   
7. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
8. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
9. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
10. The authentication type will be set to **Facebook** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with Facebook account.

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL
1. For instance, to query about the specific daily reach details, query the <i>/ACCESS_TOKEN</i> endpoint with required parameters as specified in [Facebook Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/).

Replace it in the URL to query a reach details details:

`https://graph.facebook.com/v6.0/page-id/insights?metric=page_impressions_unique&period=day&access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>`

### Sample queries
**Feeds**
	
`https://graph.facebook.com/v6.0/page-id/feed?fields=from,id,title,unshimmed_url,likes.summary(true),privacy,message,created_time,picture,comments.summary(true)&access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>`

### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.
* The Choose Schema(s) dialog opens. The schema represents the key fields of JSON data retrieved from Facebook Rest API request. This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and its corresponding values in grid for preview. Select required schema(s) from treeview to use in designer and click **Connect**.
