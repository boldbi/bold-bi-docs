## Authentication with Infusionsoft
Use the following steps to authenticate with Infusionsoft web service:

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your Infusionsoft account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by Bold BI dashboards.

   > **NOTE:**  If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.

3. Set a name to identify the account and click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect via already connected account, refer [Connected Accounts](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/infusionsoft/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

> **NOTE:**  To connect to another account click **Connect New Account.**


## Connect to Infusionsoft
### Create Infusionsoft data source
After successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Infusionsoft data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Click the **API Endpoints** down drop box and choose the required endpoint.
3. Click the **Custom Url** if you want to enter the URL manually. Refer the [Infusionsoft API documentation](https://developer.infusionsoft.com/docs/rest/#!/Account_Info/getAccountProfileUsingGET) for more details.  
4. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
5. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the Infusionsoft data source. This value is used to fetch the data from Infusionsoft data source via pagination.
6. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
7. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
8. The authentication type will be set to **Infusionsoft** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with Infusionsoft account.

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL
1. For instance, to query about the specific opportunity, query the <i>/opportunities</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed information, get the ID of the specific opportunity.

Replace it in the URL to query a particular opportunity:

[https://api.infusionsoft.com/crm/rest/v1/opportunities/&lt;:opportunity_id&gt;](https://api.infusionsoft.com/crm/rest/v1/opportunities/%3c:opportunity_id%3e)

### Sample queries
