## Authentication with QuickBooks
Use the following steps to authenticate with QuickBooks web service:

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your QuickBooks account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by Bold BI dashboards.

   > **NOTE:**  If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.
   
3. Set a name to identify the account and click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect via already connected account, refer  [Connected Accounts](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/quickbooks/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

> **NOTE:**  To connect to another account click **Connect New Account.**


## Connect to QuickBooks
### Create QuickBooks data source
After successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create QuickBooks data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid QuickBooks REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [QuickBooks API documentation](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/api/accounting/all-entities/account) for more details.

    Example: [https://quickbooks.api.intuit.com/v3/&lt;:your_end_point&gt;](https://quickbooks.api.intuit.com/v3/%3c:your_end_point%3e)    
3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the QuickBooks data source. This value is used to fetch the data from QuickBooks data source via pagination.
5. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
6. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
7. The authentication type will be set to **QuickBooks** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with QuickBooks account.

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Data Formats 
</td>
<td>
By default data is retrieved in <i>JSON</i> format. Additionally <i>XML</i> is supported in QuickBooks.

</tr>
</table>
