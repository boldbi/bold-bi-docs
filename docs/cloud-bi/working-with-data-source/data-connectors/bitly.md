## Authentication with Bitly
Use the following steps to authenticate with Bitly web service:

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your Bitly account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by Bold BI dashboards.

   > **NOTE:**  If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.
   
3. Set a name to identify the account and click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect using existing connected account, refer  [Connected Accounts](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/bitly/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

> **NOTE:**  To connect to another account click **Connect New Account.**


## Connect to Bitly
### Create Bitly data source
After successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Bitly data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Click the **API Endpoints** down drop box and choose the required endpoint.
3. Click the **Custom Url** if you want to enter the URL manually. Refer the [Bitly API documentation](https://dev.bitly.com/v4_documentation.html) for more details.  
4. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
5. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the Bitly data source. This value is used to fetch the data from Bitly data source via pagination.
6. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
7. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
8. The authentication type will be set to **Bitly** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with Bitly account.

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL
1. Replace the **&lt;:group_guid&gt;** in the URL to query the groups endpoint.
2. For instance, to get the Groups data, query the <i>/groups</i> endpoint.
3. From the listed group information get the guid.

Replace it in the URL to query a particular group:

[https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/groups/&lt;:group_guid&gt;/bitlinks](https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/groups/%3c:group_guid%3e/bitlinks)

### Sample queries
**Bitlinks**

[https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/groups/Bi9c3AFP5Fx/bitlinks](https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/groups/Bi9c3AFP5Fx/bitlinks)

**Organizations**

### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.
* The Choose Schema(s) dialog opens. The schema represents the key fields of JSON data retrieved from Bitly Rest API request. This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and its corresponding values in grid for preview. Select required schema(s) from treeview to use in designer and click **Connect**.
