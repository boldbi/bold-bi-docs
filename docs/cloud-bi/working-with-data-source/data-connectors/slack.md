## Create Slack data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Slack data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Click the **API Endpoints** down drop box and choose the required endpoint.
3. Enter a valid REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/methods) for more details.
4. Click **Custom Url** to enter the URL manually.
5. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
6. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
7. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
8. The authentication type will be set to **Slack** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with Slack account.
