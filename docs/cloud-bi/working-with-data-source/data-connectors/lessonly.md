## Create Lessonly data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Lessonly data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Click the **API Endpoints** down drop box and choose the required endpoint.
3. Enter a valid REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Lessonly API documentation](https://docs.lessonly.com/) for more details.
4. Click **Custom Url** to enter the URL manually.
5. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
6. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the Lessonly data source. This value is used to fetch the data from Lessonly data source via pagination.
7. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
8. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
9. Choose **Basic HTTP Authentication** in **Authentication Type** combo box.
10. Enter a valid Lessonly **Subdomain** and **API Key** to access the endpoints.

You can also edit the connection information set using the [Edit Connection](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL

1. Query the <i>Show User</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed information get the user id for the connected account.

Replace it in the URL to query a particular conversations:

https://api.lessonly.com/api/v1/users/<:user_id>

### Sample queries

**All User**

[(https://api.lessonly.com/api/v1/users)]

**All Assignments**

[(https://api.lessonly.com/api/v1/assignments)]

**All Tags**

[(https://api.lessonly.com/api/v1/tags)]


### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.
* The Choose Schema(s) dialog opens. The schema represents the key fields of JSON data retrieved from Lessonly Rest API request. This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and its corresponding values in grid for preview. Select required schema(s) from treeview to use in designer and click **Connect**.
