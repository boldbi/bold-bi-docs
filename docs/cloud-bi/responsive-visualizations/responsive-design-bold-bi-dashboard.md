# Responsive Design in Bold BI Dashboard
We can view the dashboards in desktop, mobile and tablet devices. The dashboard can be recomputed and adapt its view for different screen sizes and orientations. 

## Desktop Layout in Bold BI Dashboard
In Desktop layout, you can view the dashboard and perform various operations like Editing, Filtering, Views, Theme, Exporting, Comments and Sharing dashboards.

In this mode, you can view the dashboard in `Full Screen` by clicking the Full screen option in top right corner of the dashboard.

Devices which has the resolution higher than `1024 * 768` will be considered as desktop device. And the dashboards will be rendered based on it.
