# Azure Active Directory Group Import

This section explain on how to search and import groups from Azure Active Directory into the Bold BI.

> **NOTE:**  Azure Active Directory connection has to be configured in the [Azure Active Directory Settings](/cloud-bi/site-administration/azure-active-directory/) in the `General` page for importing groups.

Users belonging to the `System Administrator` group only can import Azure Active Directory groups into the Bold BI.

## Search Groups

Initially, any Active Directory groups cannot be displayed until searching for the group.

You can search the Azure Active Directory groups with any one of the below properties and choose them to import into Bold BI.

* Group name

A maximum of 1000 groups will be searched and pulled from Azure Active Directory in a single request. 

Bold BI will list the search results of the groups in the grid as shown in the below figure.
