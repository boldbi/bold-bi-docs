## Add new users

New users can be added to the Bold BI individually or in bulk using CSV import

### Add individual users

To add new users to the Bold BI, click on `New User` and then `Create User` from the User Management page. 

The `Add User` dialog will be shown as like in the image below.

Fill the form with Email address, First name and Last name and click on `Add`. 

New account will be created for the user and an account activation email will be sent to the email address with activation link to activate the Bold BI account.

The activation link sent to the user will be valid only for 2 days and if the user have not activated within the 2 days, a new activation link can be sent to the user from the user edit page. Check [Activate Users](#activate-users) section for more details.

The account will be in inactive status till the user activates the account from the activation email.

> **NOTE:**  User emails cannot be updated once created. Please make sure to provide the correct email id before create the user.

### Import users from CSV

To automate the process of adding large number of users to a Bold BI Cloud, you can download the CSV template file and add the users in it and then import the file.

You can navigate to the user management page by clicking the `User Management` dropdown under the `Admin` menu as follows.

First Name, Last Name, Phone number and the login password for the user can be edited by the user belonging to the 'System Administrator' group.

Users can be deleted from the Bold BI when the user no longer requires the access. Users can be deleted from the user management page or from the edit page.

### From user management page

## Deactivate users
Users can be deactivated at any time. Once deactivated, the user cannot log into the Bold BI.
To deactivate a user, select inactive from the status dropdown in the user edit page.

## Activate users
Inactive users can be activated by clicking on the `Resend Activation Code` button in the user edit page.

This will send an account activation email to the user with an activation link to activate the account and again this activation link will be valid only for 2 days.

If the user has not received the activation email within 2 days or missed to activate the account, the `System Administrator` has to resend the activation email to the user.
