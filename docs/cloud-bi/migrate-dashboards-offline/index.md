# Offline Migration

Offline migration refers to the process of migrating dashboards from one Bold BI site to another Bold BI site without using an internet or network connection. This migration process involves downloading the dashboard as a physical file from the source site and then uploading it to the destination site. Offline migration does not require both the source and destination Bold BI sites to be online at the same time.
