# How to give access for custom JSON using PostgreSql data source?

Bold BI application allows you to access the custom JSON data using PostgreSQL data source by following these steps.

## Steps to access custom JSON data in Bold BI

1.	Refer to the [Connecting Bold BI to PostgreSQL data source documentation](https://help.boldbi.com/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/postgresql/#connecting-bold-bi-to-postgresql-data-source) to successfully connect it.

2.	Drag and drop the table which has the JSONB data type in Bold BI as shown in the following image.

    >**NOTE:** The JSONB data type will be hidden on `data preview` but can be accessed by creating expressions in Bold BI.

3.	Click `Save` to save the data source with a relevant name to proceed with designing dashboard.

    <table>
    <tr>
    <th>
    <b>Operator</b>
    </th>
    <th>
    <b>Usage</b>
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
    -&gt;
    </td>
    <td>
    The operator -&gt; returns the JSON object field by key.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
    -&gt;&gt;
    </td>
    <td>
    The operator -&gt;&gt; returns the JSON object field by key as text.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
    Index
    </td>
    <td>
    Index(0) is used to filter data from array without using a key.
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>

7.	Assign values to the widget as shown in the following image.

9.  You can also access the JSONB data using query in a code view mode. Switch to the code view by enabling the toggle option in the tools pane in the data design view as shown in the following image.
