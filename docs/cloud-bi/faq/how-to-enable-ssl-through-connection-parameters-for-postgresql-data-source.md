# How to enable SSL through connection parameters for PostgreSQL data source

Bold BI application allows you to enable SSL through connection parameters in the PostgreSQL data source by following these steps.

## Steps to connect PostgreSQL with SSL

1.	Refer to the [Connecting Bold BI to PostgreSQL data source](https://help.boldbi.com/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/postgresql/#connecting-bold-bi-to-postgresql-data-source) for successfully connecting to it.

2.	For connecting the [PostgreSQL](https://help.boldbi.com/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/postgresql/) with SSL connection, you need to add the connection string **sslmode=Require;TrustServerCertificate=true** in the **Additional connection parameters** textbox along with the existing server details and click **Connect.**

In this way, you can enable SSL in the connection by passing parameters in the connection string.

3.	Drag and drop the table from the table schema in the data design view page.
