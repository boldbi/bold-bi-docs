# How to add a new data connector under Bold BI

Bold BI has support for various data sources including files, SQL, NoSQL, REST-based connectors, SSAS, and more. Each connector varies with the way of accessing their data and has special characteristics of supporting different authentication mechanisms, pagination, data format, data types, and endpoints. Bold BI has no support for the custom connectors at this time due to various factors involved in accessing the data.  

To add a new connector into Bold BI, you can [contact us](https://www.boldbi.com/support) with the following details.  

 1. A brief summary about the connector.

 2. Documentation link to access its data.

Bold BI technical team will validate the above details and implement the connector support for Bold BI and add it to our integration page.
