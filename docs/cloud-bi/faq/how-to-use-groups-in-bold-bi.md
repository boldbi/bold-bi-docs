# An efficient way of assigning permissions and custom attributes

This page describes how to use groups to minimize the work for assigning permissions and custom attributes to multiple users in Bold BI cloud.

## Use Groups for providing permissions to multiple users

Instead of assigning permissions to each user individually, you can use groups to provide the same set of permissions to multiple users.

Follow the given steps to assign permissions to the group:

1. Create a [Group](/cloud-bi/managing-resources/manage-groups/#add-new-group) for users who require the same set of permissions.

2. Provide [Permissions](/cloud-bi/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/manage-permissions/#manage-permissions---groups) to group.

## Use Groups for assinging Custom Attributes to multiple users

Instead of re-creating custom attributes at the user level, you can use groups to assign the same custom attributes to multiple users.

Follow the given steps to assign custom attribute to the group:

1. Create a [Group](/cloud-bi/managing-resources/manage-groups/#add-new-group) with users who will be using the same types of custom attributes.

2. Create [Group Level Attribute](/cloud-bi/working-with-data-source/configuring-custom-attribute/#group-level-attribute).
