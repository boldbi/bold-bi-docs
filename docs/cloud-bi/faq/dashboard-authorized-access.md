# How to enable authorized access to dashboards for users?

1. To enable authorized access to a dashboard for the users, you need to add the required users to your account and follow the steps mentioned in this <a href="/embedded-bi/managing-resources/manage-users/#add-new-users">link</a> to add new users to your account.

2. Once you have added the required users, you need to add the permission for the users. You can add the permissions by following the steps in this [link](/embedded-bi/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/manage-permissions/).

3. Public dashboards are accessible to anonymous users who have the dashboard link. To make this `Private`, turn off the `Public` access for the dashboard since the `Private dashboards` are accessible to the registered users in the Bold BI who have appropriate permissions. To access the Private dashboard, the users will be required to log in and they will be shown the dashboard only if they have been granted access. Refer to this <a href="/embedded-bi/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/public-dashboards/#make-private">link</a> to make the dashboard either `Private` or `Public`.
