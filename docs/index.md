# Overview of Embedded BI

Embedded BI is the integration of customized dashboards into an application, making data visualization more powerful and easier to manage. It allows you to interact with data visualizations and gain business insights from a single application. [Bold BI](/embedded-bi/setup/overview/) is a powerful tool for creating embedded dashboards.

Bold BI dashboards can be embedded in two ways: JavaScript-based embedding and iFrame-based embedding. 

In JavaScript-based embedding, you can use our embedded BI JavaScript library to embed your Bold BI dashboards in your application, which may be an ASP.NET MVC application, an ASP.NET Core application, or an Angular application. This embedding is explained by way of the samples in this section. Learn more about JavaScript-based embedding in the article ["Overview of JavaScript-based Embedding SDK."](/embedded-bi/javascript-based/) 

In iFrame-based embedding, you can embed dashboards in iFrame using the dashboard URL. This type of embedding requires some effort, as more code will be required. To learn more about iFrame-based embedding, read the article ["Embed the Dashboard in View Mode."](/embedded-bi/iframe-based/dashboard-view-mode/)

To learn how to create a powerful dashboard, refer to ["Embedded BIâ€”a Basic Walkthrough."](/embedded-bi/getting-started/quick-start/)

You can also embed a dashboard or dashboard application modules using [REST APIs](/embedded-bi/rest-api-reference/).
