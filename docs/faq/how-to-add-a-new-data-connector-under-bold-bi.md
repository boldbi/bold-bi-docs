# How to add a new data connector under Bold BI

Bold BI supports various data sources, including files, SQL, NoSQL, REST-based connectors, and SSAS. Each connector differs in the way data can be accessed and has unique characteristics supporting various authentication mechanisms, pagination, data format, data types, and endpoints. Currently, Bold BI does not support custom connectors due to the complexity involved in accessing the data.  

To add a new connector to Bold BI, please [contact us](https://www.boldbi.com/support) with the following details.  

 1. A brief summary about the connector.

 2. Documentation link to access its data.

The Bold BI technical team will validate the above details, implement the connector support for Bold BI, and add it to our integration page.
