# How to query Snowflake records using the code view mode in Bold BI

Bold BI allows you to query the records in the Snowflake data source using the Code view mode by following these steps.

## Querying Snowflake records using the code view mode

1.	Refer to the guide on [Connecting Bold BI to Snowflake data source](/working-with-data-sources/data-connectors/snowflake/#connecting-bold-bi-to-snowflake-data-source) to successfully establish the connection.

2.  Drag and drop the table from the table schema in the data design view page. Switch to the code view by enabling the toggle option in the tools pane, as shown in the following image.
