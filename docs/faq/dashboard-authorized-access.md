# How to enable authorized access to dashboards for users?

1. To enable authorized access to a dashboard for users, you need to add the required users to your account and follow the steps mentioned in this [link](/managing-resources/manage-users/#add-new-users) to add new users to your account.

2. Once you have added the required users, you need to grant them permission. You can do this by following the steps outlined in this [link](/managing-resources/manage-permissions/).

3. Public dashboards are accessible to anonymous users who have the dashboard link. To make it `private`, turn off `public` access for the dashboard, as `private dashboards` are only accessible to registered users in Bold BI with appropriate permissions. To access a private dashboard, users must log in and will only be shown the dashboard if they have been granted access. Refer to this [link](/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/public-dashboards/#make-private) to switch the dashboard between `private` and `public`.
