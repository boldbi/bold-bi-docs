# How to show Current Date and Time in Widget Title

You can show the **current date and time** in widgetâ€™s title using [Expression](https://help.boldbi.com/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/transforming-data/configuring-expression-columns/) and [Label Parameter](https://help.boldbi.com/cloud-bi/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/configuring-label-parameters/) supported by Bold BI application.

Follow these steps to achieve this requirement:

1. Create and save an expression column with `TODAY()` function.

2. In widget title, use expression column as a label parameter.
