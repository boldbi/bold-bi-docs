# How to show Current Date and Time in Widget Title

You can display the **current date and time** in widgetâ€™s title using the [Expression](/working-with-data-sources/data-modeling/configuring-expression-columns/) and [Label Parameter](/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/configuring-label-parameters/) supported by Bold BI application.

Follow these steps to meet this requirement:

1. Create and save a column with an expression using the `TODAY()` function.

2. In the widget title, use the expression column as the label parameter.

3. Preview the dashboard to help you view the current date and time in the widget title.

    By default, the current date and time will be shown when using the created expression column. You can also display a required date formatting, as well as the following.
