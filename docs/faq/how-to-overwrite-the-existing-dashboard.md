# How to overwrite the existing dashboard 

You can overwrite the dashboard that has already been created using the `Publish As` option in the Bold BI application.

Follow these steps to overwrite the existing dashboard:
1. Open an existing dashboard in design mode that contains your most recent changes.
2. Afterwards, click on the downward arrow icon in the Publish button at the top right corner and choose the `Publish As` option.
