## Why this issue occurred
`NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM` is not added to IIS/IIS EXPRESS for accessing SQL Server in Windows Authentication mode.
 
### The steps for adding `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM` to access SQL Server Windows Authentication mode in IIS or IIS EXPRESS
 
In Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, please perform the following actions on the server.
 
1.  Right click on "Login" and select `New Login` to add respective login into SQL Server.
