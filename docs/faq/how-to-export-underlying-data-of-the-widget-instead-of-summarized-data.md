# How to export underlying data of the widget instead of summarized data

When you export the widget data using the **Export** option, the exported Excel or CSV file will contain the summarized data.

You can export the underlying data of the widget to a CSV file or an Excel file using the `View Underlying Data` option in the Bold BI application.

Follow these steps to export individual rows of widget data:

1. After configuring the widget, enable the` View Underlying Data` option from the **Container Actions** properties section.
