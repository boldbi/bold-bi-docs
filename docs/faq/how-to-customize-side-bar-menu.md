# How to customize side bar menu based on user permission

This page describes how to customize side bar menu in the Bold BI application, based on user permission.

## Steps to customize side bar menu option based on user permission

1. Set the `<IsUserBasedMenu>` as true in the config file, which is available in the following location.
   * For Windows - `C:\BoldServices\app_data\bi\configuration`
   * For Linux - `/var/www/bold-services/application/app_data/bi/configuration/`

2. Restart the Bold BI Application in IIS.

3. If the user does not have any kind of permission in the sense, the dashboards and pinboards options will be displayed.

4. Hide the `Pinboards` option by setting the **ShowMenu** to **false** for the node **Pinboard** in the `custom_ui.json`, which will hide the Pinboard item for all users. Refer to this [section](https://help.boldbi.com/embedded-bi/user-interface-customization/) for customizing the `custom_ui.json` file.

5. For example, if the user has any kind of permission in data sources in the sense, it will show data sources option.

### Dashboard Dependent Menus:

If the user has permission to **Create Dashboard**, its dependent menu options **Add Dashboard and Publish** will be shown. In contrast, if the user has any other dashboard-related permissions (like Read, (Read and Write), and (Read, Write, and Delete)), then both options will not be shown.
