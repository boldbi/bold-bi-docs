# How to customize side bar menu based on user permission

This page describes how to customize the sidebar menu in the Bold BI application based on user permissions.

## Steps to customize side bar menu option based on user permission

1. Set the `<IsUserBasedMenu>` to true in the config file, which is located in the following location.
   * For Windows - `C:\BoldServices\app_data\bi\configuration`
   * For Linux - `/var/www/bold-services/application/app_data/bi/configuration/`

2. Restart the Bold BI Application in IIS.

3. If the user does not have any kind of permission, the dashboards and pinboards options will be displayed.

4. Hide the `Pinboards` option by setting the **ShowMenu** to **false** for the node **Pinboard** in the `custom_ui.json`. This will hide the Pinboard item for all users. Please refer to this [section](/site-administration/user-interface-customization/) for information on customizing the `custom_ui.json` file.

5. For example, if the user has any type of permission for data sources, it will display the option for data sources.

### Dashboard Dependent Menus:

If the user has permission to **create a dashboard**, the dependent menu options **Add Dashboard and Publish** will be shown. However, if the user has any other dashboard-related permissions (such as Read, Read and Write, or Read, Write, and Delete), then both options will not be shown.
