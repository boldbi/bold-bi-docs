# Can you use the same login credentials for the Bold BI and Bold Reports applications

Yes, Bold BI and Bold Reports applications can use the same login credentials. The Bold BI and Bold Reports applications are integrated with our **Identity Provider (IdP)**. Our IdP offers support for user management and Single Sign-On (SSO) for the Bold BI and Bold Reports products.

The user has access to the sites through the IdP. However, resource access permissions (such as Dashboards, Reports, and more) should be managed within the corresponding site.
