# How to restrict embedding Bold BI site using an iFrame?

To restrict embedding Bold BI site into another application using an iFrame, we have to set the X-Frame-Options as Deny in the response header.

At present [X-Frame-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) Header is not added in the Bold BI Application as [iFrame based embedding](/embedded-bi/iframe-based/dashboard-view-mode/) is one of the types of embedding solutions in our [Embedded BI](/embedded-bi/overview/) to embed the dashboards into another application.

Follow the below step to add the X-Frame-Options in response headers of Bold BI server.

1. Open the Web.config file and add an X-Frame-Options header like below with in `system.webServer` module,

```js
    <system.webServer>
        <httpProtocol>
            <customHeaders>
                <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value="*" />
                <add name="X-Frame-Options" value="Deny" />
            </customHeaders>
        </httpProtocol>
    </system.webServer>
```

## Web.config Directories

Since we have various distributed applications in Bold BI, We have to set the X-Frame-Options response header in the below deployed applications.

> **NOTE:** By default, the Bold BI is deployed in  "C:\BoldServices" for Windows.
