# Managing AI Features

The visibility of AI features can be managed at both the global and site level using enable/disable options.

## Global Level

At the global level, AI feature visibility can be controlled using the enable/disable checkbox for `Enable AI Agent`, `Enable widget insights and dashboard summary`.

### Guidelines for Managing AI Feature Visibility at the Global level

1. Select the `Manage Sites` option from the profile icon.

## Site Level

AI features can be enabled or disabled for a specific site using toggle options. The AI Assistant has its own individual toggle, while Widget Insights and Dashboard Summary are controlled together with a single combined toggle.

Within Site Settings, AI features can be managed at two distinct levels:

- Admin level

- User level

>**Note**: To enable or disable AI features at the site level, the `Enable AI Agent` and `Enable Widget Insights and Dashboard Summary` options must be enabled globally.

### Guidelines for Managing AI Feature Visibility at the Site for Admins

1. Select the `Manage Sites` option from the profile icon.
