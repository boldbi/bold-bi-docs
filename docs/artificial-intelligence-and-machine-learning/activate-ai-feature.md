# Activating AI Feature

## For On-Premises Users (10.1 and Later)

- Starting from the 10.1 release, on-premises users can activate AI features by globally enabling the `Enable AI Agent`. If the enable AI Agent is disabled, users will not be able to configure or use any AI-related features.

For detailed instructions on configuring AI, refer to the Configure AI documentation [Configure AI Feature Guide](/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/configure-ai/).

-  To utilize Widget Insights, Dashboard Summary, and Textual Responses, ensure that the `Enable Widget Insights and Dashboard Summary` option is enabled. Disabling this option will prevent access to these AI-powered features.
