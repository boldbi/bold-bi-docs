# Generative AI

Say goodbye to manual widget creation! With the new Generative AI in Bold BI, creating and customizing widgets is now faster and easier than ever. Instead of dragging and dropping widgets and then adding the required data, you can simply ask the assistant to do it for you.

>**Important**: We adhere strictly to **HIPPA compliance** across all our Generative AI features. Our built-in AI services are designed to operate in accordance with HIPAA requirements. However, if you choose to configure and use your own AI models through Azure OpenAI or other providers, **compliance will depend on the specific model and configuration** you select. In such cases, it's your responsibility to ensure that those models meet your regulatory and compliance standards.

## What Can the Generative AI Do?
1. **Create widgets** instantly just by asking! Want a bar chart? Pie chart? Simply ask the generative AI.

2. **Customize your widgets** with ease. Need to change the title, description, background color, or labels? Just tell the AI Copilot, and it will update everything for you.

3. **Select your data sources** either a single or multiple data sources in the AI Copilot, which supports queries related to the selected data sources. Enter the `@` character to display a list of available data sources for selection.

### Example:
 - Want to create a bar chart? Just say, `Create a bar chart showing sales by region.` The Generative AI will generate it instantly!

- Need to update the background color or title? Just ask, `Change the background color to blue and update the title to 'Sales Overview'.`
