# Using the AI Assistant in Dashboard Designer

The AI Assistant is a conversational chat tool powered by Large Language Models, designed to help you create charts based on your input. It simplifies data investigation and dashboard creation, making it easy to visualize data and uncover valuable insights effortlessly.

## How Does the AI Assistant Generate Widgets?

1. Begin by attaching a datasource to start interacting with the AI Assistant.

2. You can begin by simply using the sample generated questions or with your own query to visualize your data.

3. You can ask the AI Assistant to visualize the attached data source. For example, if you're working with a Pet Disease datasource, you can simply ask `Distribution of diseases for each pet in stacked column`.

5. The AI Assistant takes into account your previous four conversations, tailoring its responses to better meet your needs and preferences.

6. After a widget is created, you can review and provide feedback by clicking the like or dislike buttons.

>**NOTE**: Your feedback will be stored for 90 days to help improve the AI Assistantâ€™s performance.
