# About Q&A Widget
The BoldBI Q&A widget is an AI-powered tool that simplifies the process of converting data into visual charts by using natural language commands. It employs AI models using the AI Assistant service to comprehend your queries and crafts relevant charts, streamlining the process of data investigation and dashboard creation.

>**Breaking Changes:** Starting from Bold BI v8.1, the Q&A widget will integrate with our dedicated AI service. As a result, no fine-tuning process or initial configuration setup is required on your end to utilize the Q&A widget. 
For versions prior to Bold BI v8.1, fine-tuning your data is necessary to use the Q&A widget. Please refer to the [Fine-Tuning Guide](/utilities/fine-tuning-utility/) for more details.

## Activation of Q&A widget

Now, resize the container as required to drag multiple widgets in it.

## Questioning the Q&A widget 
The Q&A widget features a search bar where users can enter their queries. Begin by stating the desired information in conversational language. For instance, you might input, `Show sales by region`.

Our AI model will understand your question phrased in everyday language, determine the relevant data, and select the appropriate chart format. The Q&A widget takes into account previous questions when responding to the current query, providing tailored responses to meet user preferences.

Afterward, the Q&A widget will create the visual representation of the data you requested, drawing from the dataset you have provided.

When you select the dislike option, a prompt will appear, allowing you to inform the BoldBI team about your reasons for disliking. This action will generate an email to the BoldBI team that includes the question, the data source's column names relevant to the widget in question, and any error logs. Your feedback will be used to enhance the AI model.

The email will be sent from the email configured in the [Email settings](https://help.boldbi.com/site-administration/email-settings/email-settings-configuration/). 


## Transforming the Q&A Widget into a Regular Widget

You have the option to transform the widget generated from the Q&A into a regular widget, which provides additional customization features to tailor the chart according to your preferences.

To initiate the transformation, select the `Convert to standard widget` icon. This action will change the current Q&A widget into a regular widget, maintaining the same dimensions. After conversion, it will function just like any other standard widget, ready for further customization.

>**Note**: Once converted, it is not possible to revert to the Q&A widget. Should you require modifications to the question, please proceed by incorporating a fresh Q&A widget within the designer.

## View Mode for Questions and Answers Feature

The Questions and Answers feature can be deployed on the dashboard, enabling end users to pose questions to the linked data sources within the dashboard and view the resulting charts.
