# Getting Started with the AI Copilot
We recommend watching the following video, which offers essential insights on effectively getting started with the AI Copilot in Bold BI.<br/>

1. The AI Copilot is conveniently located at the bottom-right corner of your window of your dashboard designer and dashboard viewer only.

2. `Cloud` users must activate the AI Copilot before they can start using it. For detailed instructions on enabling AI in Bold BI, refer to the [Activate AI Feature Guide](/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/activate-ai-feature/)

3. After activating the AI Copilot, make sure to attach a datasource to begin interacting with it.

4. You can easily drag and resize the AI Copilot window to suit your workspace needs.

>**Note**: `On-Premise` users do not need to activate AI.


## Auto-Generated Queries

Once a datasource is connected, the AI Copilot will automatically create four sample queries based on the tables in your datasource. These queries will help you get started quickly.

## Monitoring Your AI Usage
 
You can easily monitor your AI Copilot usage. This includes:
- The number of tokens used in the current session

- The total tokens used today

- Your remaining token balance

This helps you keep track of your AI consumption with ease.

>**NOTE**: Token usage includes interactions with the Q&A widget, except for session usage.

## Minimizing and Continuing Later

If you donâ€™t need the AI Copilot for a while, you can minimize it and pick up the conversation later without losing your session. Keep in mind that the session will automatically end after 2 hours of inactivity.
