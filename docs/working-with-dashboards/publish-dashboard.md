# Publishing a Dashboard

A new dashboard or an existing dashboard can be published with same or different `Name` in the site. While publishing the dashboard, you can also add the `Description` for the dashboard, if required.

Publishing operation can be handled using the option in the tools pane of the design view items such as, `Publish` and `Publish As`

Click `Publish` in the tools panel. In order to `Publish As` the existing dashboard, click the down arrow near the publish icon and select `Publish As`. 

The `Publish As Dashboard` dialog box will be opened, on which category and name can be selected where the dashboard need to be published.

While saving the dashboard, some special characters are not supported in the dashboard name.

Click `Publish` to save the dashboard.

Saving the dashboard for the first time, will prompt the `Publish AS` dialog even when you click the `Publish`.

On publishing the dashboard, if same name already exist with the selected category, it will prompt `Confirm Publish Dashboard` dialog to replace the dashboard in the selected category. By selecting `Yes`, the dashboard will be replaced in the category specified.
