# Publishing a Dashboard

A new dashboard or an existing dashboard can be published with the same or a different `Name` on the site. While publishing the dashboard, you can also add a `Description` if necessary.

The publishing operation can be handled using the options in the tools pane of the design view items, such as `Publish` and `Publish As`.

To publish, click on `Publish` in the tools panel. To `Publish As` an existing dashboard, click the down arrow near the publish icon and select `Publish As`.

The `Publish As Dashboard` dialog box will open, where you can select the category and name where the dashboard needs to be published.

Enter the name and description for the dashboard.

By selecting `Mark as public`, the dashboard will be saved as a public dashboard.

Some special characters are not supported in the dashboard name when saving.

Click `Publish` to save the dashboard.

When saving for the first time, the `Publish As` dialog may appear even when clicking `Publish`.

If a dashboard with the same name already exists in the selected category, a `Confirm Publish Dashboard` dialog will prompt to replace the dashboard in the specified category. Selecting `Yes` will replace the dashboard.

After successfully publishing a dashboard, you will be prompted to view the published dashboard. Selecting `Yes` will navigate to view the subsequent dashboard.
