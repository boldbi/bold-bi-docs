# Publishing a Dashboard

A new dashboard or an existing dashboard can be published with same or different `Name` in the site. While publishing the dashboard, you can also add the `Description` for the dashboard, if required.

Publishing operation can be handled using the option in the tools pane of the design view items such as, `Publish` and `Publish As`

Click `Publish` in the tools panel. In order to `Publish As` the existing dashboard, click the down arrow near the publish icon and select `Publish As`. 

The `Publish As Dashboard` dialog box will be opened, on which category and name can be selected where the dashboard need to be published.
