# Create Schedule in Dashboard View Mode

If the user has `Read` permission for a specific dashboard and the permission to create a schedule, then only the user can create a schedule in that dashboard.

### Steps to create a Schedule

1. Open the dashboard and click on `Schedule this view` option on the dashboard header to initiate the schedule creation process

2. If a dashboard has no views, the schedule dialog box will not display a views dropdown menu when attempting to create a schedule.

3. If the user applies a filter and saves it, and then attempts to create a schedule, the schedule dialog box will display a views dropdown. However, the dropdown will be `pre-selected` with the saved view and disabled to prevent any changes to the selected view.

4. If the user has an unsaved filter and attempts to create a schedule, an information dialog will appear and ask the user to save the current filtered view before scheduling.

5. If the user does not have permission to create schedule, a dialog box with specific content will be displayed instead of the schedule dialog box when attempting to create a schedule.
