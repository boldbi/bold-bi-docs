# Previewing Dashboard

  You can preview the currently opened dashboard by clicking the `Preview` button in the top right corner of the tools pane.

  The preview button is visible across all window tab views in the Dashboard Designer, allowing you to preview the dashboard from anywhere within the application.
  
## Previewing dashboard using dashboard viewer

   The dashboard can be previewed using the built-in dashboard viewer, which opens in the default web browser.

   The dashboard viewer can be split into two sections: `Title` and `Content`, as shown in the following screenshot.

   The `Title` section contains the dashboard title and description (viewed by clicking the `i` icon next to the title) that were set in the Dashboard Designer before publishing.

   The update and export operations of the dashboard can be handled at runtime by using the highlighted icon below.

   The `Content` section contains the complete content of the dashboard design area in Dashboard Designer.

   You can interact with dashboard widgets in the viewer and apply filters on top of other widgets based on the dashboard filters configuration made in the dashboard through Dashboard Designer.

   Each widget in the dashboard viewer is split into two sections: `Title` and `Content`.

   You can edit the title of the widget before previewing it.
   
   It also includes options such as maximize, drop-down menu, and filter status at the right end.
