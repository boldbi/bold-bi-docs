# Share Dashboards

Share dashboards with your colleagues to enhance visualizations and achieve great results using our secure Bold BI platform with a flexible permission system.

There are various methods available for sharing your dashboard with users on your Bold BI site:

* [Get links to Dashboards](/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/get-dashboard-link/)

* [Manage access permissions for your dashboard](/managing-resources/manage-permissions/)

* [Share to anonymous users](/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/public-dashboards/)

* [Collaboration](/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/collaboration/)

* [Dashboard scheduling](/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/schedule-dashboards/)

* [Notifications](/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/notifications/)

Continue learning how to manage [data sources](/managing-resources/manage-data-sources/), [schedules](/managing-resources/manage-schedules/), [users](/managing-resources/manage-users/), [groups](/managing-resources/manage-groups/), [administer the site](/site-administration/) and [connect with the Bold BI site programmatically](/server-api-reference/).
