# Collaboration in the Bold BI

This section explains how to collaborate with other users in the Bold BI cloud by commenting on dashboards.

The Collaboration feature in Bold BI allows users to write comments on a dashboard to share with other users who have access to the dashboard. It is useful for tracking events and providing insights into those events. Users can also add links to other dashboards or any external websites.

Anyone with access to a dashboard can write comments. When a comment is added to a dashboard, users who have notifications enabled in their profile will receive email and system notifications. You can learn more about notifications in [this](/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/notifications/) documentation.

## Post a new comment

To post a new comment, open the dashboard and click on the **comment** icon in the top-right corner as shown in the following image.

## Mention Users in comments

Users can be mentioned in comments to notify them about the comments by email.

To do this, type `@` followed by the user’s name, and then select the user from the list of possible names to mention them in a comment.

Click [here](/working-with-dashboards/commenting-dashboard/) for more details about dashboard and widget commenting.

## Notification
Whenever dashboards or widgets receive comments, users will be notified in two different ways: 

1. System notification.
2. Email notification.

Learn more about the notification [here](/working-with-dashboards/share-dashboards/notifications/).

> **NOTE:**  An email setting is not necessary for collaboration. If email settings are not configured, then email notifications will not be sent.
