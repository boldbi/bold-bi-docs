# Manage Permissions

You can grant dashboard access to users or groups with Read, Read and Write, or Read, Write, and Delete permissions. You can also revoke this access using the share permission dialog on the dashboard listing page.

For more information, please visit the [Manage dashboard](/managing-resources/manage-dashboards/share-dashboards/) section.
