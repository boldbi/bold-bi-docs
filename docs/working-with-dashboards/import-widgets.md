# Bold BI widgets import feature
The Widgets import feature allows you to import configured widgets from existing dashboards into a new dashboard. When drilling into dashboards where you have read-write permission, you will have access to all the widgets on the dashboard, which you can then drag into the current dashboard.

Follow the steps below to reuse the widgets:

1. Click on the `Existing` tab in the widgets toolbox panel to see all the dashboards where you have read-write permission.

    The existing panel with dashboards will now be displayed.

2. Click on a dashboard to display all the widgets on that dashboard.

3. You can drag widgets from different dashboards to the current dashboard.

    > **NOTE:**  The imported widgets are independent and will not be affected when the original widgets are changed, but they will share the same data source.
