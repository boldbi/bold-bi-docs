# Bold BI widgets import feature
Widgets import feature allows you to import the configured widgets from existing dashboards in a new dashboard. While drilling into those dashboards that you have read-write permission, you will get all the widgets of the dashboard, and you can drag that widgets to the current dashboard.

Follow the below steps to reuse the widgets.

1. Click the `Existing` tab in the widgets toolbox panel to view all dashboards that you have read-write permission.

    > **NOTE:**  The imported widgets are then independent and will not be affected when the original widgets are changed but it only shares the same data source.
