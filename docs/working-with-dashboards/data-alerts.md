### Data Alert

Data alert screen has the option to add conditions for the desired dashboards. Each condition has the source column name, aggregation, and target column to compare. A `Where Condition` can be added as globally or for each condition. After the successful validation, the user can be navigating to the next screen, otherwise, the error message displayed at the top of the dialog box and the screen remains exists until the successful validation.

1. Select the `Widget` that you want to add the threshold condition and select any one of the `Condition`. By Default, the condition will be `Value Changes`.

   ![select-column](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/select-dataalert-widget.png)
  
   1.`Value Changes` - Checks whether the filtered value changes and can be evaluated either expression or a single column.
   
   If it is an expression, the user can be notified when it satisfies the condition.

   * The user can add the expression as per their need as follows.
   
       ![Condition Type 1](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/condition-valuechanges.png)
   
   * To switch the expression to a single column click on the close button as below,  
   
       ![valuechanges-removecomparisontarget](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/valuechanges-removecomparisontarget.png)

   * Click `Add Comparison Target` to add expression.  
    
       ![valuechanges-addcomparisontarget.png](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/valuechanges-addcomparisontarget.png)
 
  If it is a single column, the user can be notified when there is a change in the column value compared to the previous value.
 
   2.`Increases` - Checks whether the filtered value increases once.

   3.`Continuously Increases` - Checks whether the filtered value increases continuously.

   4.`Decreases` - Checks whether the filtered value decreases once.

   5.`Continuously Decreases` - Checks whether the filtered value decreases continuously.  
 
2. Add more conditions by clicking the `Add Condition`.

3. Add `Where` condition for each filter by clicking the `Add Where Condition`.  

  ![add-where-condition](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/add-where-condition.png)

4. The column values can be compared with custom or actual values. Actual values are listed from the database and the custom values are the input provided by the user.

## Create a New Expression

In data alert, a new option is included to create expressions with the combinations of unbounded data source columns of selected widget and multiple functions. For instance, [Sum(Column1) - Sum(Column2)].

### Steps to add a custom expression

1. After selecting the widget, click `Create expression columns` label at the top of filter in the data alerts screen.  

  ![Expression-icon](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/custom-expression-label.png)  

2. Create expression dialog box opens as follows.  

  ![Expression-dialog](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/custom-expression-screen.png)

  In previous dialog box, create expressions column lists all the saved expressions of the appropriate data source.

  You can add a new expression by providing values to name and expression input fields.

  Functions and column settings drop-downs provides multiple functions and data source columns of selected widget to create expressions.

3. Click `Add` to add a default expression name in the name input field.

  Expression name can also be changed. 

  ![expression-name](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/expression-name.png)

4. Expressions can be formed with the combinations of functions and column names, from the functions and column settings drop-downs.  

  ![Expression-function-columns](/static/assets/embedded/visualizing-data/working-with-widgets/images/function-column-dropdowns.png)

  Functions and column settings are categorized under various types and they can also be filtered by the first drop-downs underneath their headings.

  Expression can be inserted into its input field by double clicking the required values from the functions and column settings drop-downs.
