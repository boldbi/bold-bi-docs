# Dynamic Translator

The Dynamic Translator feature in Bold BI allows you to customize dashboard content in any desired language by inputting translated text corresponding to the original English content. This functionality enhances the user experience by delivering dashboard information in users' preferred languages. It supports translations for the following items:

1. Title and Description of the Dashboard  
2. Title, Subtitle, and Description of the Widget  
3. Column Header of the Widget  
4. Title of the Chart Axis  
5. Header of the Tab  
6. Tooltips

## Accessing the Dynamic Translator

The Dynamic Translator feature can be found in the toolbar of the design canvas, as illustrated below.
