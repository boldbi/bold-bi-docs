# Bold BI sample dashboard templates 

Dashboard Templates are pre-built dashboards that allow you to quickly create your own awesome dashboards! Choose the template, enter the credentials, and your fully functional dashboard is created in mere seconds. Upon creation, you can modify the dashboard to further customize it based on your preferences.

> **Note:** This feature is available in Syncfusion Managed Cloud Server but not in On-Premises Deployment.

Follow these steps to quickly publish the dashboard with your data over the template you have selected:

1. Click `Connect your data` from the chosen template. This will open the authentication window.
