# What is Single sign-on
Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to securely authenticate with multiple applications and websites using only one set of credentials. This eliminates the need for users to log in separately to different applications. By using a single security token (a combination of username and password), you can manage user access to multiple systems, apps, and resources. SSO has revolutionized the traditional login process and significantly reduces the time-consuming task of logging in to each application with different passwords.

## Supported SSO in Bold BI
Bold BI has single sign-on (SSO) support for the following login providers:
* [Configure SSO with ADFS](/security-configuration/single-sign-on/azure-active-directory/)

* [Configure SSO with OAuth 2.0](/security-configuration/single-sign-on/oauth-2.0-support/)

* [Configure SSO with OpenID Connect](/security-configuration/single-sign-on/openid-support/)

> **NOTE:** This feature is available in Bold BI Embedded Analytics but not in Cloud Analytics Server.
