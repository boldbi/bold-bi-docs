# Evaluation Quick Start

Welcome to the **Evaluation Quick Start guide** — your first step in exploring the full potential of our BI platform.

This guide is designed specifically for new users, decision-makers, and developers who are evaluating the platform during the free trial period. Whether you're assessing our [**self-service**](/overview/self-service-analytics/) capabilities or testing [**embedded analytics**](/overview/embedded-analytics/) scenarios, this quick start guide will help you make the most of your time. These resources will help you experience real-world scenarios and confidently assess whether the platform aligns with your organizational needs.

The purpose of this guide is to:

- Provide a streamlined introduction to the platform for first-time evaluators

- Facilitate a quick hands-on experience with core product features

- Highlight [useful resources](/evaluation-quick-start/help-resources/) and [prebuilt examples](/evaluation-quick-start/sample-dashboards/) to accelerate the evaluation process

- Support decision-making by showcasing real-world usage scenarios

This section is designed to guide you through essential evaluation components of the platform, enabling you to gain both conceptual understanding and limited hands-on experience before full deployment or integration begins.

Through the following areas, you will gain insight into evaluating core features relevant to self-service analytics and embedded BI workflows:


| **Topic**               | **Description**                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**Sample Dashboards**](/evaluation-quick-start/sample-dashboards/)   | Discover a library of ready-to-use dashboards curated across different industries and roles. These examples serve to illustrate best practices in data visualization, layout organization, widget usage, and KPI design. You can use them to compare expected outputs with your own business metrics or use them as templates when you move to full implementation. |
| [**Help Resources**](/evaluation-quick-start/help-resources/)| Access a comprehensive set of self help resources including product documentation, troubleshooting guides, knowledge base articles, release notes, community forums, and support contact points. This ensures that even during evaluation, users can independently resolve queries or explore advanced topics such as security configuration, performance tuning, or deployment modes. |
