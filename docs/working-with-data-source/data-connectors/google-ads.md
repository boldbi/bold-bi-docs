# Google Ads Data Source
Bold BI dashboard designer supports connecting Google Ads web services through REST API.

> **NOTE:**  If you want to connect **Google Ads** data source, your account must be linked to Google Analytics.

## Choose Google Ads Data Source
To configure the Google Ads data source, follow the below steps:
1. Click the **Data Sources** button in the configuration panel to add a new data connection.

## Authentication with Google Ads
Use the following steps to authenticate with the Google Ads web service:

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your Google Ads account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by Bold BI dashboards.

   > **NOTE:**  If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.

3. Set a name to identify the account and then click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect through an already connected account, refer to the [Connected Accounts](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/google-ads/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

> **NOTE:**  To connect to another account click **Connect New Account.**


## Connect to Google Ads
### Create Google Ads data source
After the successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create a Google Ads data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Select **account**, **properties**, and **view** value.
3. You can choose a specific date as a **start date** and **end date** respectively by using the date picker controls. If you choose the launch date option, Google ads initial launch date will be considered as the start date for the API. Similarly, if no end date option is selected, the current date will be passed as the end date to pull data up to date during data source creation and data source refresh.
4. Choose your **metrics** and **dimension** or enter valid URL in the **custom URL** textbox. Refer to the [Google Ads API documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/mgmt/v3/mgmtReference/) for more details.

    Example: [https://www.googleapis.com/analytics/v3/data/ga?ids=&lt;:id&gt;&start-date=&lt;:startDate&gt;&end-date=&lt;:endDate&gt;&metrics=ga:users,ga:sessions,ga:pageviews&dimensions=ga:month,ga:year&sort=-ga:month](https://www.googleapis.com/analytics/v3/data/ga?ids=%3c:id%3e&start-date=%3c:startDate%3e&end-date=%3c:endDate%3e&metrics=ga:users,ga:sessions,ga:pageviews&dimensions=ga:month,ga:year&sort=-ga:month)
5. Select the **GET** method for the REST API in the **Method** combo box.
6. In-**Page(s)**, enter the maximum number of pages to be fetched from the Google Ads data source. This value is used to fetch the data from the Google Ads data source via pagination.
7. Choose a time interval for the **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
8. Select the **JSON** data type in the **Data Format** combo box.
9. The authentication type will be set to **Google Ads** automatically because OAuth is used for authenticating with the Google Ads account.
