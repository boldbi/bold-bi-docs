## Authentication with YouTube
Use the following steps to authenticate with YouTube web service:

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your YouTube account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by Bold BI dashboards.

   > **NOTE:** If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.

3. Set a name to identify the account and click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect using existing connected account, refer [Connected Accounts](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/youtube/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

> **NOTE:** To connect to another account click **Connect New Account.**


## Connect to YouTube
### Create YouTube data source
After successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create YouTube data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid YouTube REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [YouTube API documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/) for more details.

    Example: 'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels?part=snippet&mine=true'  
3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
5. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
6. The authentication type will be set to **YouTube** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with YouTube account.

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL
1. For instance, to query about the specific caption details, query the <i>/captions</i> endpoint with required parameters as specified in [YouTube Documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/captions/list).
2. From the listed group information, get the particular caption ID.

Replace it in the URL to query a particular calendar details:

'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/captions/<:caption_id>'

### Sample queries
**Activities**

'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/activities'

### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.
* The Choose Schema(s) dialog opens. The schema represents the key fields of JSON data retrieved from YouTube Rest API request. This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and its corresponding values in grid for preview. Select required schema(s) from treeview to use in designer and click **Connect**.

   ![Preview](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/common/Preview.png)

* Now, the data design view page with selected table schema opens. Drag and drop the table.

* Click **Save** to save the data source with a relevant name.

## Connected accounts for OAuth data sources
