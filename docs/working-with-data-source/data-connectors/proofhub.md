## Create ProofHub data source

Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow these steps to create the ProofHub data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid ProofHub REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer to the [ProofHub API documentation](https://github.com/ProofHub/api_v3) for more details.

      Example: `https://<:company_name>.proofhub.com/api/v3/projects`

3. Select the **GET** method for the REST API in the **Method** combo box.
4. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with your dashboard.  
5. Select the **JSON** data type in the **Data Format** combo box.
6. Replace **&lt;:your_api_key&gt;** under Headers with a valid API key.
7. Choose **None** under the **Authentication** Type, as authentication is done using the header.
