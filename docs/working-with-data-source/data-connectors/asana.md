## Authentication with Asana
Use the following steps to authenticate with Asana web service.

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your Asana account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by Bold BI dashboards.

   > **NOTE:** If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.
   
3. Set a name to identify the account and click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect via existing account, refer [Connected Accounts](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/asana/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

> **NOTE:** If you need to connect to another account click **Connect New Account.**

## Connect to Asana
### Create Asana data source
After successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Asana data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid Asana REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Asana API documentation](https://asana.com/developers/documentation/getting-started/quick-start) for more details.

   Example: `https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects` 

3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the Asana data source. This value is used to fetch the data from Asana data source via pagination.
5. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
6. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
7. The authentication type will be set to **Asana** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with Asana account.

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
API Limits
</td>
<td>
To keep it available for all users and stability Asana enforces multiple kinds of limitations. The free domain have 150 request per minute and the premium domain have 1500 request per minute.

In addition **Search APIs** are limited to 60 requests per minute.
