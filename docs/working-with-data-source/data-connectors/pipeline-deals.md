## Create PipelineDeals data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create PipelineDeals data source.

2. Enter a valid PipelineDeals REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [PipelineDeals API documentation](https://app.pipelinedeals.com/api/docs) for more details.

    Example: [https://api.pipelinedeals.com/api/v3/deals.json?api_key=&lt;:your_api_key&gt;](https://api.pipelinedeals.com/api/v3/deals.json?api_key=%3c:your_api_key%3e)    

3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched the data source. This value is used to fetch the data from the data source via pagination.

6. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
