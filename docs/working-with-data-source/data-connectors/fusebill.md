## Create Fusebill data source
Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Fusebill data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid Fusebill REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Fusebill API documentation](https://developer.fusebill.com/reference) for more details.

    Example: [https://secure.fusebill.com/v1/customers/?pageNumber=0&pageSize=20&sortOrder=descending&sortExpression=createdTimestamp](https://secure.fusebill.com/v1/customers/?pageNumber=0&pageSize=20&sortOrder=descending&sortExpression=createdTimestamp)    

3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched. This value is used to fetch the data via pagination.
5. Replace **&lt;:your_api_key&gt;** under Headers with a valid **API key**.
6. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
7. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
8. Choose **None** under **Authentication Type**.

#### How do I get API Key for connecting Fusebill data source?
1. Login to [Fusebill](https://admin.fusebill.com/Account/Login) account. Go to *Settings -> Integrations -> API Key*.
2. Use this *API Key* as **API Key** in Fusebill data source in Bold BI Dashboard.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL

1. For instance, to get the specific customer details, query the <i>/customers</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed information get the ID of the specific customer.

Replace it in the URL to query a particular customer:

[https://secure.fusebill.com/v1/customers/&lt;:customer_id&gt;](https://secure.fusebill.com/v1/customers/%3c:customer_id%3e)

### Sample queries
**Specific Customer Email Preferences**

[https://secure.fusebill.com/v1/customers/12345/CustomerEmailPreferences](https://secure.fusebill.com/v1/customers/12345/CustomerEmailPreferences)

**Subscription**

[https://secure.fusebill.com/v1/subscriptions/98765](https://secure.fusebill.com/v1/subscriptions/98765)

### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.

This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and its corresponding values in grid for preview. Select required schema(s) from treeview to use in designer and click **Connect**.
