# Connecting Bold BI to ActiveCampaign data source

Bold BI dashboard designer supports connecting ActiveCampaign web services through REST API.

## Choose ActiveCampaign data source

To configure the ActiveCampaign data source, follow the below steps:

1. Click the **Data Sources** button in the configuration panel to add a new data connection.

## Create ActiveCampaign data source

Once you click the data source, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create ActiveCampaign data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid ActiveCampaign REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [ActiveCampaign API documentation](https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference) for more details.

   Example: [https://&lt;your-account&gt;.api-us1.com/api/3/connections](https://%3cyour-account%3e.api-us1.com/api/3/connections)

3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the ActiveCampaign data source. This value is used to fetch the data from ActiveCampaign data source via pagination.
5. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
6. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
7. Replace `<:your_app_token>` under Headers with a valid API key.
8. Choose **None** under **Authentication** Type, as authentication is done through header.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
API Limits
</td>
<td>
ActiveCampaign API has a rate limit of 5 requests per second per account. Contact them for a custom rate limit solution.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL

1. Log in to your account and get your Base URL on the My Settings page under the "Developer" tab.
2. Replace *&lt;:your-account&gt;* with this base URL.
3. Replace *&lt;:resource&gt;* with a valid endpoint.

[https://&lt;your-account&gt;.api-us1.com/api/3/&lt;:resource&gt;](https://%3cyour-account%3e.api-us1.com/api/3/%3c:resource%3e)
