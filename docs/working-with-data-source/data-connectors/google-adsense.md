# Connecting Bold BI to Google AdSense data source
Bold BI dashboard designer supports connecting Google AdSense web services through REST API. 

## Choose Google AdSense data source
To configure the Google AdSense data source, follow the below steps:
1. Click the **Data Sources** button in the configuration panel to add a new data connection.

2. Click **CREATE NEW** to launch a new connection from the connection panel.
3. Select the **Google AdSense** connection in the connection panel.

> **NOTE:**  You can also create a data source from the home page by clicking the **Data Sources** menu from left menu panel and **Create Data Source** from the data sources page.

## Authentication with Google AdSense
Use the following steps to authenticate with Google AdSense web service:

1. Click the data source, you will be prompted with a login window. Enter the credentials of your Google AdSense account to authorize.
2. Click **Allow** in the authorization window to accept the scopes requested by Bold BI dashboards.

   > **NOTE:**  If the permission is denied, the account will not be accessible from the dashboard.

3. Set a name to identify the account and click **Next**. 
4. You have now successfully authorized your connection. Click **Connect** to continue with the data source connection.
5. To connect using existing connected account, refer [Connected Accounts](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/data-connectors/google-adsense/#connected-accounts-for-oauth-data-sources).

> **NOTE:**  To connect to another account click **Connect New Account.**


## Connect to Google AdSense
### Create Google AdSense data source
After successful authentication, the NEW DATA SOURCE configuration panel opens. Follow the below steps to create Google AdSense data source.
1. Enter a name and description (optional) for the data source.
2. Enter a valid Google AdSense REST API endpoint in the URL textbox. Refer the [Google AdSense API documentation](https://developers.google.com/adsense/management/v1.4/reference/) for more details.

    Example: [https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts](https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts)    
3. Select **GET** method for the REST API in **Method** combo box.
4. In **Max Rows**, enter the maximum number of rows to be fetched from the Google AdSense data source. This value is used to fetch the data from Google AdSense data source via pagination.
5. Choose a time interval for **Refresh Settings** using the combo box, to trigger the Rest API request periodically to keep the data in sync with our dashboard.  
6. Select **JSON** data type in **Data Format** combo box.
7. The authentication type will be set to **Google AdSense** automatically since OAuth is used for authenticating with Google AdSense account.

You can also edit the connection information set here using the [Edit Connection](/embedded-bi/working-with-data-source/editing-a-data-connection/) option.

#### Additional information
<table width="600">
<tr>
<td>
Max Rows
</td>
<td>
Most of the REST APIs return only fewer data on a single API request. To pull the amount of data you need, set a value in this field.  
Pagination is handled internally and will fetch the amount of data you need.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh Settings
</td>
<td>
Period of time before next refresh call is triggered. This will automatically trigger a call for the API configured in the data source to keep the data up to date. If you do not want to sync your new data, choose ‘Never’.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Setting up the URL
1. For instance, to query about the specific account detail, query the <i>/accounts</i> endpoint.
2. From the listed group information, get the particular account ID.

Replace it in the URL to query a particular account details:

[https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts/account_Id](https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts/account_Id)

### Sample queries
**List of all accounts**

[https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts](https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts)

**List all *Ad Clients* in specific account**

[https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts/jhgowjHGS83/adclients](https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts/jhgowjHGS83/adclients)

**List all *Payments* of specific account**

[https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts/jhgowjHGS83/payments](https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts/jhgowjHGS83/payments)

**List all *saved reports* in specific account**

[https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts/jhgowjHGS83/reports/saved](https://www.googleapis.com/adsense/v1.4/accounts/jhgowjHGS83/reports/saved)

### Preview and data import
* Click **Preview & Connect** to connect with the configurations set.
* The Choose Schema(s) dialog opens. The schema represents the key fields of JSON data retrieved from Google AdSense Rest API request. This dialog displays a list of schemas in treeview and its corresponding values in grid for preview. Select required schema(s) from treeview to use in designer and click **Connect**.

   ![Preview](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/common/Preview.png)

* Now, the data design view page with selected table schema opens. Drag and drop the table.

* Click **Save** to save the data source with a relevant name.

## Connected accounts for OAuth data sources
If you have already logged into the account and authenticated with web data source, the account information will be listed here. You can select one of the accounts or connect to a new account by clicking the **Connect New Account** button.

   ![OAuth](/static/assets/embedded/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/GoogleAdSense/OAuthDS.png)

You can edit, delete and re-authorize this account from the **Connected Accounts** page.
