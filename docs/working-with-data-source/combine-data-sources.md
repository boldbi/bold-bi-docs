# How to create combine data source

Combine data source feature allows you to create a new data source from the existing extracted mode data sources by appending all rows with column mapping.

To create combine data source, click `Combine Data Source` from the data source listing page.

The default column mapping based on the source table columns is shown as follows. If the target table column does not match with the source table column, `NULL` value is selected by default. You can select the desired mapping column using this window.
