**Virtual Machine Name:** Enter a name for your virtual machine (VM). The name must be 15 or fewer characters.

**VM disk type:** choose SSD/HDD for your convenience(We recommend using SSD for better performance).

**Size:** Choose the VM size that meet our [system requirement](/embedded-bi/setup/overview/#hardware-requirements). For example, choose the `D2s_V3` size, and then click `Select`.

**Username:** Enter your username. You will use this username to log in to the VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

**Password:** Enter your password. You will use this password to log in to the VM using RDP.

**Subscription:** The Azure subscription this VM should be associated with.

**Resource group:** Choose `Create new` and then enter the name of a new resource group to host the VMâ€™s resources.

**Region:** Choose your convenient region for your VM.

* Under the `Disks` blade, you can choose the VM OS disk type based on your convenience. (We recommend using `SSD` for better performance).

* Click `Create new` on the `NIC network security group` option to add inbound security rule. Creating an inbound rule that allow specific types of internet traffic to reach your VM.

![Add inbound rule](/static/assets/embedded/setup/images/self-vm-add-inbound-rule.png)

* On the `Add inbound security rule` blade, in the `Service` drop-down list box, choose` HTTP`.

* In the Priority box, give the rule a priority, for example, 100. Lower numbers are processed first. For example, a rule priority of 100 will be processed before a rule priority of 110.

* In the Name box, enter a name for the inbound rule, for example HTTP Port-80, and then click OK.

* Repeat steps to create a Add inbound security rule for the HTTPS service with a priority of 101.

* When complete, the Create network security group dialog should include three rules to allow `RDP, HTTP, and HTTPS` access. Click OK.

* On the `Create` blade, under Summary, review your settings and click `Create`.

## Install and run the Bold BI server

This section explains how to install and run the Bold BI server in VM. 

* Install the Bold BI server on the created VM in Azure portal by this [help link](/embedded-bi/setup/deploying-in-windows/installation-and-deployment/). 
* Launch your application by default or your Desktop shortcut menu item. For example, `Start Bold BI in IIS`

![Start up](/static/assets/embedded/setup/images/boldbi-startup.png)
