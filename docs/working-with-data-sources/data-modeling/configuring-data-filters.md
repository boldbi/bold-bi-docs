# Data filters 

## Configuring Data Filters

  Data Filters can be configured to restrict record visibility based on defined criteria. The configuration can be done by adding and deleting a filter condition.
  
### Adding a filter condition

   Click on the `Filters` option shown in the data design view window. The Data Filter window will open.

   ![Data filters](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/datafilters.png)

   Add a filter condition by clicking the `Add` button in the `Data Filters` window.

   ![Filters wizard](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/filterswizard.png)

   Now, a filter condition will be added by default as shown below:

   ![Filter condition](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/filtercondition.png)
   
   You can filter values with or without `Null` by checking or unchecking the `Include Null` option. If you check this option, only `Equals` and `Does Not Equal` conditions will be shown. Based on these conditions, you may filter values with or without `Null`.

   Modify the condition as needed and define the criteria. The condition can be defined based on two options:
   1. Custom
   2. Parameters

### Custom
   In the custom option, filter the records based on the columns. The parameters to define will differ based on the data type.

   For columns like date time or text type, you may see a toggle button for TOP `N` on the right to enable the Top `N`filter and configure the field and condition.

   Below example shows top 5 freight data of a city.

   For numeric type columns, the parameters will be as shown below:

   ![Numeric type](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/numerictype.PNG)

   ![Select operators](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/selectoperators.PNG)
   
   The example below shows data of freight with values greater than 500. 
   
   ![Filter greater than](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/filtergreaterthan.png)

   Upon clicking `OK` in the dialog above, the Data Preview grid will appear as shown below.

   For date and time columns, the parameters will be as follows:

   ![Date time](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/datetimetypefilter.png)

   ![Select date time type](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/selectdatetimetype.PNG)

   ![Check all](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/selectcheckall.PNG)

   ![Date time options](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/datetimeoptions.png)
   
   The example below shows data within the specified date range.

   To add more than one condition, click the `Add` button.

   > **NOTE:**  By default, the AND operation will be used between two conditions. The operator can be changed to OR if necessary. 

   Click `OK` to save the defined data filter conditions.

   Click `Close` or the Close icon at the top right corner of the window to close the Filters window.

#### Parameters
Filter the records based on the dashboard parameter values. This allows for dynamically changing the parameter values in both view and preview modes.

   Click on the `Parameters` option as shown below.

   ![Parmeters Option](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/parameteroption.png)

   Select the desired parameter lists from the dropdown menu. The first parameter will be selected by default.

   The following example displays data where the selected table column is equal to the chosen dashboard parameter. To create parameters, follow the instructions provided in [configuring dashboard parameters](/working-with-data-sources/dashboard-parameter/configuring-dashboard-parameters/)

   ![Data Preview](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/images/datapreview.png)

   For a date column with a date range type, only date format parameters will be shown.

   > **NOTE:**  Support is only provided for dimensions, measures, and date columns with date range types.

### Deleting a filter condition

   Remove a filter condition by clicking the highlighted icon on the right of the respective filter condition.
