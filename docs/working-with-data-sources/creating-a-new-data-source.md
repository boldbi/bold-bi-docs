# Working with Data Sources

This section explains how to create a new data source and fetch data from it.

## Creating a New Data Source

To bind data to a widget, a minimum of one data source is required. Follow these steps to create a data source:

1. Click the `Data Source` button in the configuration panel. The data panel will open.
