# Slack

Slack is a popular messaging and collaboration platform for teams and organizations.

## Grab User OAuth Token

To set up the pipeline, create a Slack app in your workspace to obtain a user token for accessing the Slack API.

1. Navigate to your Slack workspace and click on the name at the top-left.
2. Select Tools > Customize Workspace.
3. From the top-left Menu, choose Configure apps.
4. Click Build (top-right) > Create a New App.
5. Opt for "From scratch", set the "App Name", and pick your target workspace.
6. Confirm with Create App.
7. Navigate to OAuth and Permissions under the Features section.
8. Assign the following scopes:

   | Name               | Description                                                |
   |--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
   | ``admin``              | Administer a workspace                                     |
   | ``channels:history``   | View messages and other content in public channels         |
   | ``groups:history``     | View messages and other content in private channels        |
   | ``im:history``        | View messages and other content in direct messages         |
   | ``mpim:history``       | View messages and other content in group direct messages    |
   | ``channels:read``      | View basic information about public channels in a workspace|
   | ``groups:read``        | View basic information about private channels              |
   | ``im:read``            | View basic information about direct messages                |
   | ``mpim:read``          | View basic information about group direct messages          |
   | ``users:read``         | View people in a workspace                                 |

   >**Note:** These scopes are adjustable; tailor them to your needs.

9. From "OAuth & Permissions" on the left, add the scopes and copy the User OAuth Token.
