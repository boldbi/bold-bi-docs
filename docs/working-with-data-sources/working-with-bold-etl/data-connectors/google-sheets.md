# Google Sheets

Google Sheets is a cloud-based spreadsheet application offered by Google as part of its Google Workspace suite.


### Service Account Credential

Service account credentials are better suited for server-to-server interactions. Here, we recommend using service account credentials.

#### Google Service Account Credentials

To get API credentials using a GCP service account, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. Create a service account if needed.
3. Enable "Google Sheets API" (refer to Google documentation for comprehensive instructions).
4. Generate credentials:
   - Navigate to IAM & Admin in the console's left panel, then select Service Accounts.
   - Identify the service account you intend to use, and click on the three-dot menu under the "Actions" column next to it.
   - Create a new JSON key by selecting "Manage Keys" > "ADD KEY" > "CREATE".
   - Download the ".json" file containing the necessary credentials for future use.



## Connection Properties

In a YAML file, the `config` section contains the following properties:

```yaml
