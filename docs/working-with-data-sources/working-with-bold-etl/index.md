# Working with ``Bold ETL`` in our Bold BI

## Getting Started


### Overview

Bold ETL application is to load data from various data sources into  Bold BI Data Store database, ``PostgreSQL``, ``MSSQL``, ``MySQL`` and ``Apache Doris``. Provides options to schedule the job at regular interval to pull data from data sources. Supports transformation using SQL scripts.

For Windows OS, Python 3.9 version is installed along with Bold BI Enterprise Edition for Bold ETL. If Python 3.9 version is installed already, please specify the Python path in ``{Drive}:\BoldServices\etl\etlservice\appsettings.json`` and restart the app in the IIS server.
