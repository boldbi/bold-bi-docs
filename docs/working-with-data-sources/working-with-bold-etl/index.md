# Working with Bold ETL in our Bold BI / Bold Reports

## Overview

The primary objective of the Bold ETL application is to facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from diverse sources such as ``PostgreSQL``, ``MSSQL``, ``MySQL``, and ``Apache Doris`` and ``Bold BI Data Store`` database. we can conveniently schedule recurring jobs to retrieve data from these sources and utilize SQL scripts for data transformation purposes.

## Integrated ETL Architecture

For Windows OS, Python 3.9 version is required along with Bold BI or Bold Reports  for Bold ETL. If Python 3.9 version is already installed, please specify the Python path in ``{Drive}:\BoldServices\etl\etlservice\appsettings.json`` and restart the app in IIS server.

```  
"PythonPath": "<Drive>:\\BoldServices\\Python39" 
```
