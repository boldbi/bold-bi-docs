It will take you to the **Load** page to configure the source and destination connector settings.

## Load:

We can configure the details of the source data source connector in a **YAML** file format.

In the Connector list panel, the data source name is listed. Select the connector name and click on Add Template for sample configuration details. A sample template source configuration will be added. Multiple connectors can be added to a single project to move data into a destination database.
