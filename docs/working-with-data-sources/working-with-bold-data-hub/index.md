# Working with Bold Data Hub in our Bold BI / Bold Reports

## Overview

The primary objective of the Bold Data Hub application is to facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from diverse sources such as ``PostgreSQL``, ``MSSQL``, ``MySQL``,``Oracle``, ``Google BigQuery ``, ``Snowflake`` and ``Apache Doris`` and ``Bold BI Data Store`` database. we can conveniently schedule recurring jobs to retrieve data from these sources and utilize SQL scripts for data transformation purposes.

## Integrated Bold Data Hub Architecture
