# Working with Bold Data Hub in our Bold BI / Bold Reports

## Overview

The primary objective of the Bold Data Hub application is to facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from diverse sources such as file types and web, SQL, and NoSQL data sources. please refer to [Working With Data Hub Connectors](https://help.boldbi.com/working-with-data-sources/working-with-bold-data-hub/data-connectors/). we can conveniently schedule recurring jobs to retrieve data from these sources and utilize SQL scripts for data transformation purposes.

## Integrated Bold Data Hub Architecture

```
