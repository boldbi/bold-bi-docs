## On Demand Schedule:

Data refresh can be initiated on demand by selecting the **Run Now** option.

 > **Note:** ``Run Now`` option only works if we save the ``Project`` in ``Load`` tab.
 

## Interval Schedule:


1. To configure interval-based scheduling, click on the schedules tab and select the created pipeline and click on the schedule icon and configure it.
