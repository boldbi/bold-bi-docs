  2. Click `Add Project` and provide the name for the new project.
  
   ![Matomo Data Hub - BoldBI](/static/assets/working-with-etl/images/addpipeline.png#max-width=100%)
  
  3. Select the newly created project and add the `Matomo` template.

  4. Update the API token and Url in the template. Also, Update the resources on the `select` property and Click Save, choose the desired destination to save the pipeline.

```js
The available resources are supported in Matomo 
- matomo_reports 
- matomo_visits
 ```
   5. Creating a Pipeline in Bold Data Hub automatically creates a Data Source in Bold BI. The Bold BI Data Source is a live data source to the destination database used in Bold Data Hub. For more information on the relationship between Bold Data Hub Pipeline and the associated Data Sources in Bold BI , please refer to [Relationship between Bold Data Hub Pipeline and Associated Data Sources in Bold BI]

(https://help.boldbi.com/working-with-data-sources/working-with-bold-data-hub/relationship-between-bold-data-hub-pipeline-and-associated-data-sources-in-boldbi/)

>**Warning:**
    1. The `Encrypt_Credentials` property should be set to false when updating the new access token on the template. If you have modified other properties, such as 'select' or 'account id', the `Encrypt_Credentials` property must be set to true.  
    2. The default lifetime of the access token is 1 hour. Therefore, you need to convert it to a long-lived access token in order to use the same token for 60 days. Existing tables should be maintained even if the token has expired or is being used as an invalid token. 

### Schedule Data Hub Job

1. To configure interval-based scheduling, click on the schedules tab and select the created pipeline and click on the schedule icon and configure it.
