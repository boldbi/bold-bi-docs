# ``Personio``

``Personio`` is a ``human resources management software`` that helps businesses streamline ``HR`` processes, including recruitment, employee data management, and payroll, all in one platform.

## Grab Credentials

To load data from ``Personio``, you need to obtain API credentials, `client_id` and `client_secret`:

1. Sign in to your ``Personio`` account, and ensure that your user account has API access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > API credentials.
3. Click on "Generate new credentials."
4. Assign necessary permissions to the credentials, which include read access.

## Connection Properties

The `config` section in a YAML file includes the following properties:

```yaml
Connectorname: Personio
Client_id: ID of the client
Client_secret: Client secret
```

### Example Configuration

```yaml
