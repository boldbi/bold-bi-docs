# How to create combine data source

The combine data source feature allows you to create a new data source by combining existing extracted mode data sources. This is done by appending all rows with column mapping.

To create a combined data source, go to the data source listing page and click on `Combine Data Source`.

If you want to map the data source columns, use the `Column Mapping` option.

The default column mapping is based on the source table columns. If the target table column does not match with the source table column, a `NULL` value is selected by default. You can select the desired mapping column using this window.

Once you have finished mapping the columns, click on `Append` to create the new data source. This will take you to the data source editing page, where the appended data is shown in the preview grid.

You can change the column mapping by clicking on the settings icon near the table name.

To view the combined tables list, expand the arrow icon near the table name.

You can also combine new tables from the shared tables option.

If you want to remove a table from the combined table list, use the delete icon.

To save the data source, click on `Save and Exit`.

Now, the combined data source has been created successfully. On the server page, the `Data Refresh Status` will be shown.
