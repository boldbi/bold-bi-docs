# Connecting Bold BI to Google Drive data source
`What is Google Drive?` Google Drive is a storage service offered by `Google` to store files and folders in a web-based cloud drive. It also provides support for synchronization services with your local devices, keeping files synced with Google Drive and adding benefits for a backup system and reducing local storage usage.

## Connecting to a Google Drive

To enable this connection, follow the given steps:

1. Click the `Data Source` button in the configuration panel to add a new data connection.
