# Connecting Bold BI to Excel Data Source
Bold BI dashboard designer allows you to connect Excel files from both local and cloud storage.

## File Prerequisites
* Bold BI supports connecting Excel workbooks created with version 2007 and later with `.xlsx` and `.xls` file extensions. 

* The prepared workbook should be structured. It should be created with unique column names, and the values in a row must be in the same data type for the corresponding columns. 

* The values in the first row of your worksheet will be considered as column names by default in Bold BI. So, provide unique and meaningful column names in your spreadsheet that will make it easy to identify your data.

* You can upload a maximum of file size 200 MB.

## Connecting an Excel file from Local Storage
To connect an Excel file from local storage, follow the below steps:

1. Click the **Data Sources** icon in the configuration panel to add a new data connection.

3. Click the **Reconnect** button and now your data will now be updated.

## Refreshing Cloud Excel Data Source
Bold BI allows you to `refresh` the cloud-stored Excel data on your dashboard. You can update this by creating a schedule to transfer data from your cloud location to an intermediate database location.

Follow the below steps to refresh the data:

1. Click the **Refresh Settings** button in data source designer page.
![Refresh cloud excel](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/Excel/refresh-cloud-excel.png)
 
2. Select the type of recurrence, recurrence frequency, and start and end dates in the `Refresh Settings` dialog box.
    * Data refresh can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly or monthly.
    * The Application Time Zone is displayed below the date picker. The start time of the schedule is converted to the client's Time Zone and shown on the right side for the user's convenience.

    ![Refresh settings window](/static/assets/working-with-datasource/data-connectors/images/Excel/refresh-settings-window.png) 
             
3. Now click the **Schedule** button.

> **NOTE:**  In cloud storage, you may either replace the latest file with one of the same name or edit your existing file and save it with the modified content before a refresh is triggered. If the schema changed in the uploaded file, then data will be lost in your dashboard.

> **NOTE:**  You can also schedule a refresh for an already created data source. Click [here](/managing-resources/manage-data-sources/#refresh-setting) to learn more.
