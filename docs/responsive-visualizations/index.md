# Responsive behavior in Bold BI

Generally, a responsive design in a website allows the user to have a great experience irrespective of size of the devices to view the site.

Our `Bold BI` site also supports the responsiveness for different layouts in different devices.

Bold BI allows you to view the dashboard in three kinds of layouts,

* Desktop
* Mobile
* Tablet

We can see the responsive visualizations of Bold BI Dashboard [here](/embedded-bi/responsive-visualizations/responsive-design-bold-bi-dashboard/).

Also, we can see the responsive visualizations of Bold BI Server [here](/embedded-bi/responsive-visualizations/responsive-design-bold-bi-server/).
